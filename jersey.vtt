00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:52.055
Hello.
- Hi.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:53.638
How are you?
- I'm good.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.630
Do they have it?
- No.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.408
Do you have any
more copies of Jersey?

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:07.710
I just sold the last copy.
I'm sorry.

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:10.427
Okay, we'll come back later.

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:12.448
What? This is your fault.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:13.861
I wanted to make a
pre-order but you said no.

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:14.973
Now look what happened.

00:02:16.883 --> 00:02:19.472
Even if we order it online,
we'll get it after two days.

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:20.734
I've been waiting
for it for so long.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:22.284
The world won't end
if you don't read that book.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:23.475
Hello.
- Stop grumbling.

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:25.352
Excuse me. Hi.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.144
I guess you are
looking for this book.

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:31.347
Did we ask for this?
What were you doing? Stalking us?

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:32.600
Just wait.

00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:38.196
He's my dad.

00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:42.851
I'll be more than happy
if you read about him.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.917
Here.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.524
Have a good day.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:51.861
Congratulations.
Your book is a huge success here.

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:53.649
And everything is sold out.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.572
'Thanks. And every news
channel is covering it.'

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.946
'Also, BCCI will call you.'
- BCCI?

00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:01.402
'Yeah, I want to tell you
the good news before they call.'

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.011
'They are arranging for
Arjun's felicitation ceremony'

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:04.685
'in Hyderabad this Saturday.'

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.559
'All of you must come.'

00:03:06.878 --> 00:03:09.211
We'll definitely come.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.761
'Okay, then.
I'll see you soon here.'

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:12.178
Yeah. Bye.
- 'Bye.'

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.212
Is he really your father?

00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:40.417
'2 triple centuries.'

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.716
'7 double centuries.'

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:45.027
'36 100s.'

00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:46.909
'78 50s.'

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:51.898
'Best batsman of his time.
My dad. Arjun.'

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.849
'Sarah. Mom.'
- Arjun!

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.783
'Always crazy about my dad.'

00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.923
I love you!

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.620
Dad.

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.275
Dad.

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:28.611
Oh God! Don't start
it early in the morning.

00:05:29.323 --> 00:05:31.347
I need to get to
my 8 o' clock shift.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:35.824
Please let me sleep in
peace at least for an hour...

00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:40.319
Nani, please don't make noise.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.166
Dad!

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:20.867
Do you remember what this Friday is?

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.948
Friday.
- I didn't mean that, dad.

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:26.210
The date.
- July 10th.

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:29.402
It's my Nani's birthday too.

00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:31.394
Dad!

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.983
Even though I've
more runs to my credit

00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:36.711
Coach made Vishal the
captain of our school team.

00:06:36.791 --> 00:06:38.399
Really?
- Yes, dad.

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.585
He has Indian jersey.

00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:42.504
The whole team supports him.

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:46.345
He wears it for every
match and shows it off.

00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.404
Dad, are you listening?

00:06:49.262 --> 00:06:54.282
I'll definitely become
captain if I have that t-shirt.

00:06:56.495 --> 00:06:58.006
Dad!

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.897
Nani!

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:31.160
Concentrate on the game.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.443
Forget who's wearing
what and play the game well.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:36.889
Captain is not the
best player of the team.

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.369
He's the one who leads
the team to play well.

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:42.452
Your Coach knows who
can do that job well. Got it?

00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:47.722
Go. It's time for practice.

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.090
Hurry up. You need to finish
practice and get to school.

00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:54.863
We need to stop at
the sports store on the way

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.835
and get a birthday gift.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.080
Will you really buy a jersey?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.665
If you keep your hand on my
head and say it it's like a promise.

00:08:07.813 --> 00:08:10.282
I crossed my fingers too.

00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:13.541
You can't break the promise now.

00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:20.527
Nice shot!

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.556
Come on, Nandu!

00:08:38.302 --> 00:08:39.878
He plays well, doesn't he?

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:43.036
My boyfriend.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.145
Come on, Nandu!
Superb! One more four!

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.288
Hey! Stop shouting!

00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:04.272
If you shout one more
time I won't let you

00:09:04.352 --> 00:09:05.440
enter the ground from tomorrow.

00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:13.549
Who is he to stop me?

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:15.822
He should be a watchman,
not a coach.

00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:22.437
Your boyfriend's body
balance is not even.

00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:23.951
He is tilting more to his right.

00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:25.835
He'll get out with a leg spin.

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:33.856
Come on! You can do it!

00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:38.273
Leg spinner?

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:50.433
You jinxed it.

00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:52.882
You said it and the exact
same thing happened there.

00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:58.001
It's over.
We won't be going to a movie today.

00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:01.405
He'll be in a very bad mood.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.766
Come.

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:11.869
There's no balance in your stance.

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:14.057
If you tilt more to you right

00:10:14.137 --> 00:10:16.092
you will definitely
get out with a leg spin.

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:18.543
Who's telling you all this?

00:10:18.623 --> 00:10:19.683
I know.

00:10:22.407 --> 00:10:23.492
Let's go.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.533
Hello, champion!

00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:29.975
How are you?
- Sir!

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:32.355
I know I haven't done
anything worth mentioning

00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:33.560
but every time you call me champion

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.149
it makes me feel that
I did something great.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.147
There's no doubt about it.

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:40.763
You were the most stylish
batsman in our cricket club.

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:43.573
You were supposed to
be in the Indian Team...

00:10:43.653 --> 00:10:45.250
Stop it, sir. If anyone
hears you they will beat us up.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.351
Why would they beat us up?

00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:48.510
You scored 1 triple century
and 3 double centuries

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.807
in 1st class cricket.
28 centuries, 65 half centuries...

00:10:50.887 --> 00:10:52.412
Okay, let's go.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:07.766
How is your wife?

00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:09.419
She's good.

00:11:09.499 --> 00:11:12.304
She's a good woman.
This is where you fell in love.

00:11:12.384 --> 00:11:13.993
Hello, sir.

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:15.937
Did you bring everything?
- Yes, sir.

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:17.840
The watchman has the keys.

00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:19.279
Ask him to keep the
goods in the storeroom.

00:11:19.359 --> 00:11:20.613
Okay, sir.

00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:22.578
New Zealand and India
tour is coming up.

00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:25.783
Before the One Day
International with India

00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:27.831
there's a charity match
with Hyderabad Club.

00:11:27.911 --> 00:11:29.720
I'm making arrangements for that.

00:11:30.004 --> 00:11:32.592
You hit 5 sixes in
Air India match, right?

00:11:34.314 --> 00:11:36.258
Why do you always
come back to this topic?

00:11:37.428 --> 00:11:40.196
No matter how many places
we go to we've to come back home.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:41.863
This is the same.

00:11:43.108 --> 00:11:45.184
But I vacated that
home 10 years ago, sir.

00:11:45.676 --> 00:11:49.571
You didn't vacate it, Arjun.
You ran away.

00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:54.396
Listen to me. The club
still needs an Assistant Coach.

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:57.652
You can happily do
what you are good at doing.

00:11:58.493 --> 00:12:02.002
I quit cricket 10 years ago.
It didn't happen then.

00:12:02.082 --> 00:12:04.681
I don't want to work as an
Assistant Coach in the same place.

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:09.974
Think about it. I know you.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.892
You are a very different
Arjun on the ground.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.920
The last time I saw
you with a brave face

00:12:16.512 --> 00:12:20.807
you were on a 66 foot
pitch with a 3 foot bat.

00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:32.755
You came too late.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.510
If you had come before,
then your work would have been done.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.725
No doubt. Definitely.

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:37.148
Congratulations, you are selected.

00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:38.504
Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:40.259
Thank you, sir.
- Yes!

00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:41.786
All the best.
- Thank you so much.

00:12:41.866 --> 00:12:43.230
Congratulations. I told you.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.806
Only money can get you in.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:52.468
Everything totally
changed overnight.

00:12:53.301 --> 00:12:55.598
It was in the papers
that you were selected

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:57.441
but they are claiming
that it was a printing mistake.

00:12:57.994 --> 00:12:59.956
Nobody has a conscience.

00:13:01.686 --> 00:13:04.030
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.160
You weren't selected
just like last time.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.135
Does that need such
a strong reaction?

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.969
What happened to you? God!

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.037
My boy! It's not so easy
to get a spot in Indian Team.

00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:38.605
You'll have to deal
with many more obstacles.

00:13:38.887 --> 00:13:43.022
I'm 26 years old, sir.
I have a family now.

00:13:43.102 --> 00:13:44.578
I've a government job offer on hand.

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:50.279
Maybe this is my limit.
I don't want to waste another year.

00:13:50.578 --> 00:13:51.912
What should I do if the
same thing happens next year too?

00:13:51.992 --> 00:13:53.904
Then try again the year after that.

00:13:54.474 --> 00:13:56.135
You don't say when you quit.

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:58.459
Please let me be, sir.

00:13:58.847 --> 00:14:01.371
Arjun! Arjun!

00:14:02.185 --> 00:14:03.447
Arjun!

00:14:12.282 --> 00:14:13.535
Why do you stop here every day?

00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:17.441
You are smiling in those photos,
dad. You look good.

00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:20.107
So are we really going
to the sports shop now?

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.802
Go inside and check out the bats.
I'll buy your gift.

00:14:34.882 --> 00:14:36.884
Okay dad!
- What's up, Arjun?

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.572
How is Nani's practice going on?

00:14:38.652 --> 00:14:39.772
Are you coming back from the ground?

00:14:41.145 --> 00:14:43.997
Indian jersey...
- Yes, I have original jerseys.

00:14:44.077 --> 00:14:46.439
Limited edition.
They are on sale.

00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:52.650
How much is it?
- 500 rupees.

00:14:55.909 --> 00:14:58.898
Nani's birthday is coming
up in two days. It's for him.

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:00.786
I'm a little low on money now.

00:15:01.252 --> 00:15:04.058
If you give it to me now,
I will pay by the end of the month.

00:15:04.252 --> 00:15:07.517
Look, Arjun.
I pay 10,000 rupees a month as rent.

00:15:07.597 --> 00:15:09.559
5,000 rupees for bank loan.

00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:11.360
Then the workers'
salaries and maintenance

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.191
comes up to 20,000 rupees.

00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:16.318
Put yourself in my place and see.
Can you do it?

00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.871
You are a good player, Arjun.
I respect you.

00:15:21.034 --> 00:15:23.842
Because of that respect
I can only no to you.

00:15:24.326 --> 00:15:26.433
Dad, did you get the jersey?

00:15:26.513 --> 00:15:29.259
Nani, your size is
not in stock right now.

00:15:29.383 --> 00:15:31.597
It will arrive in two days.
Dad will bring it for you.

00:15:32.152 --> 00:15:36.731
This poster is your
birthday gift from me.

00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:39.414
Thank you.
- God bless you, son.

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:44.625
Thanks.

00:15:53.998 --> 00:15:55.043
Let's go.

00:15:59.985 --> 00:16:01.161
Here you go.

00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:03.548
You come here.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.978
Why do I have to remind
you every day to pray?

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:07.799
Come on.

00:16:08.706 --> 00:16:10.396
Nani, hurry up.
- Go, go, go.

00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:11.646
Come on, we are late.

00:16:11.898 --> 00:16:13.149
Bye.
- Bye.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.371
Get in. Take your bag.

00:16:18.262 --> 00:16:19.803
Bye, dad.
- Bye.

00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:40.443
Sarah...

00:16:40.523 --> 00:16:43.189
I kept 100 rupees beside
the TV for the electricity bill.

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:44.828
The due date is gone.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.891
If we don't pay they will
cut the power this evening.

00:16:49.393 --> 00:16:50.929
I need to buy a gift
for Nani's birthday.

00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:53.466
How much?
- 500 rupees.

00:17:01.965 --> 00:17:03.306
Did you go to the lawyer?

00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:07.474
No, I'll go today.

00:17:07.554 --> 00:17:08.918
What's keeping you busy?

00:17:11.078 --> 00:17:14.935
You watch cricket on TV
all day and smoke cigarettes.

00:17:15.594 --> 00:17:16.985
You have nothing else to do.

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.831
Do you have any plans
to start working again?

00:17:34.337 --> 00:17:36.200
The roof has been leaking for days.

00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:38.455
I've been telling you since a month

00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:39.843
to talk to the owner
and get it fixed.

00:17:39.923 --> 00:17:41.214
Sarah, I need 500 rupees.

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:44.608
You have a son who
wants expensive things

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:46.439
but you don't have
a wife who earns that much.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.206
Sorry, I don't have money.

00:17:48.524 --> 00:17:49.589
Why are you lying to me?

00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:51.773
I know you have
money in your account.

00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:56.163
Oh, you know?
But I won't give you. Okay?

00:17:58.166 --> 00:17:59.844
Pay the electricity
bill without fail.

00:17:59.924 --> 00:18:02.404
And meet the lawyer...

00:18:30.145 --> 00:18:31.774
Hey, Rajesh.
Not today. I've a lot of work to do.

00:18:32.442 --> 00:18:33.873
Give us the keys.
Go do your work and come back.

00:18:33.953 --> 00:18:35.356
Come inside.
- Hi.

00:18:37.361 --> 00:18:38.725
Hello.

00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:41.302
We had a fight this morning.

00:18:41.382 --> 00:18:42.986
That's why I brought alcohol.

00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:44.589
No alcohol, please.

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:46.237
She said she'll come
early this evening.

00:18:46.857 --> 00:18:48.225
Will you have rum?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.347
Hi, boss.

00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:55.009
Hi.
- Hi.

00:18:55.089 --> 00:18:56.634
What took you so long?

00:19:00.942 --> 00:19:02.471
Who's that guy who's wearing
shades inside the house?

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.746
Where did you find him?

00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:06.447
He came from Amalapuram
to become a hero.

00:19:06.527 --> 00:19:07.536
I met him today morning.

00:19:07.616 --> 00:19:08.948
He got a small role in a bar scene

00:19:09.028 --> 00:19:12.269
so I brought him
here to rehearse for it.

00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:14.247
The poor fellow looks naive.

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:17.043
He is naive but he is super rich.

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:19.213
He sponsored the drinks for today.

00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:31.561
Cheers, man!
- Cheers!

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:34.019
Will you play?

00:19:34.184 --> 00:19:35.264
No, I've work.

00:19:35.344 --> 00:19:38.767
We are six of us.
You'll get 500 if you win it.

00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:50.460
Rajesh!

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.600
Yes?
- I want to play too.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.951
That's the spirit.

00:19:53.031 --> 00:19:55.451
Let's show these guys
what you are capable of.

00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:56.534
I almost forgot.

00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:58.317
If you win you'll have to
forget the 100 rupees I owe you.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.109
Hey!
- Give him place. Sit down.

00:20:00.189 --> 00:20:01.809
I didn't even start yet and
you are eyeing my prize.Sit down.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:03.187
Cut it.
- Take it.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.135
I don't drink alcohol, Arjun.

00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:13.868
He said his friend is shooting a
bar scene so I'm practicing for it.

00:20:14.018 --> 00:20:16.175
An actor needs dedication.

00:20:16.255 --> 00:20:18.017
I'm sorry I didn't
introduce him to you.

00:20:18.141 --> 00:20:20.067
He's Raju Babu, a movie actor.

00:20:20.578 --> 00:20:22.867
Movie actor?
I thought his face looks familiar.

00:20:22.947 --> 00:20:25.191
You remember the
movie we saw last week?

00:20:25.323 --> 00:20:27.909
When the hero's friend dies,
he stands beside the coffin

00:20:27.989 --> 00:20:30.614
and swears that he won't
rest until he kills the villains.

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:33.613
Who was in the coffin in that scene?
Our Raju Babu.

00:20:33.693 --> 00:20:35.002
Really?
- Yes.

00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:37.615
Did you see my face in the coffin?

00:20:37.832 --> 00:20:40.385
And he says my face looks familiar.

00:20:50.841 --> 00:20:52.141
Take a card.

00:20:52.221 --> 00:20:55.165
Arjun, this house looks
like government quarters.

00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:57.200
But it is filled
with cups and trophies.

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:59.312
Are you a sports person
or a government employee?

00:20:59.392 --> 00:21:01.414
He was both at one
time but now he's neither.

00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:02.936
What do you mean?

00:21:03.016 --> 00:21:05.987
He quit cricket and
they fired him from the job.

00:21:06.507 --> 00:21:08.389
How can they fire
you if you quit cricket?

00:21:08.469 --> 00:21:09.768
No, Raju.

00:21:09.848 --> 00:21:10.953
Do you remember two years ago

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:12.620
when there were complaints
about increased corruption

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.787
they did an investigation
and suspended 15 employees

00:21:14.867 --> 00:21:16.013
from the Gowliguda FCI?

00:21:16.162 --> 00:21:18.962
He was one of them.
The case is still in court.

00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:20.507
Until the final verdict
comes out all the 15

00:21:20.587 --> 00:21:22.118
employees are under suspension.

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:23.442
What about you, Raju?

00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:24.853
Since when did you
want to become a hero?

00:21:25.194 --> 00:21:28.327
When I was a little kid,
hero Nageshwar Rao

00:21:28.407 --> 00:21:30.498
came to our village to
shoot for the movie Aaradhana.

00:21:30.578 --> 00:21:32.536
Raju, you were talking
about Akkineni Nageshwar Rao's

00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:34.133
movie this morning?

00:21:34.332 --> 00:21:36.452
I thought you were referring
to Chiranjeevi's movie.

00:21:36.532 --> 00:21:37.847
So you are from way back.

00:21:37.927 --> 00:21:40.820
That's right. I got interested
in movies after I saw that shoot.

00:21:46.403 --> 00:21:47.438
Show!

00:21:47.518 --> 00:21:49.949
20% percent commission
or you'll forget yesterday's 100?

00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:51.030
Yeah right.

00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:53.575
Shall we play another game?
- I don't have money.

00:21:55.117 --> 00:21:56.126
Give me the matchbox.

00:22:09.158 --> 00:22:11.937
'The prime minister of
India Atal Bihari Vajpeyee...'

00:22:12.017 --> 00:22:14.201
Dad, when will buy me the jersey?

00:22:14.721 --> 00:22:19.216
Dad, I told my friends today

00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:22.482
that you are buying
me a jersey for my birthday.

00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:27.359
[indistinct news
playing on television]

00:22:27.981 --> 00:22:31.943
Dad, jersey!
Dad, jersey! Dad, jersey!

00:22:32.164 --> 00:22:33.587
What's that on your face?

00:22:34.073 --> 00:22:36.028
Come here. Come to me.

00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:48.766
Does it tickle here?
I said I'll buy it for you.

00:23:00.865 --> 00:23:03.593
Indian jersey for his birthday...

00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:05.231
I told you this morning.

00:23:05.753 --> 00:23:09.389
I told you to talk to the owner.
Did you do that?

00:23:10.093 --> 00:23:11.807
No, I'll talk to him tomorrow.

00:23:17.139 --> 00:23:18.956
He never asked me
anything before, Sarah.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.451
Did you go to the lawyer?

00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:22.559
I'll go tomorrow.

00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:31.000
Didn't you pay the electricity bill?

00:23:39.125 --> 00:23:40.240
Sarah...

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.743
Why are you so irresponsible?

00:23:42.823 --> 00:23:45.183
Don't you understand
what we are going through?

00:23:45.462 --> 00:23:47.548
We haven't paid the
house rent in 3 months.

00:23:47.796 --> 00:23:49.142
We are drowned in debts.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.511
Next month we have
to pay Nani's school fee.

00:23:52.427 --> 00:23:55.292
How can you be indifferent?

00:23:58.702 --> 00:24:04.178
Dad! Some uncle came
and cut the power.

00:24:05.982 --> 00:24:07.878
Let's light candles.
- Yes.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.071
Arjun, you are next.

00:25:19.195 --> 00:25:21.270
Where is Arjun?
- He went to the washroom.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.431
He went to the washroom now?

00:25:22.511 --> 00:25:24.750
He's the next batsman.
Do you think this is a joke?

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.666
Where are you going that side?
Washrooms are this way.

00:25:26.746 --> 00:25:28.057
I'll bring him.

00:25:38.825 --> 00:25:39.877
Arjun!

00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:41.891
Arjun!

00:25:41.971 --> 00:25:43.756
Arjun... Arjun...

00:25:44.587 --> 00:25:47.282
It's your turn to bat.
Coach is angry. Come on.

00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:51.581
He's calling you. Go.

00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:52.861
One last kiss.

00:25:54.968 --> 00:25:56.358
Now go. Go.

00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:02.288
I said I want to kiss you.

00:26:14.714 --> 00:26:16.414
It's your turn to bat.
Coach is angry. Come on.

00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:18.721
Is It? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:24.539
She's the reason he
plays so well every time.

00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:26.641
Anyone can play well
with a warm-up like this.

00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:28.889
Speak softly. He's a mad man.

00:26:28.969 --> 00:26:30.466
What? Will he beat me up?

00:26:30.937 --> 00:26:32.022
Hey!

00:26:33.678 --> 00:26:35.483
Arjun! Stop!

00:26:36.755 --> 00:26:38.211
Arjun, no! Stop!

00:26:41.431 --> 00:26:42.688
Stop! Let him go!

00:26:43.811 --> 00:26:45.338
Hey, no! Stop!

00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:52.049
Arjun! Arjun, let him go!

00:26:58.894 --> 00:27:01.396
Hey! I said let him go!

00:27:07.234 --> 00:27:12.533
Stop it! Let him go!
Will you kill him? He'll die!

00:27:13.072 --> 00:27:14.269
Hey, wait!

00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:15.971
Leave my hand!
Let him beat him up.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.390
Don't stop him.
- We are getting late.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.473
He doesn't do anything for me.
Let him do this.

00:27:19.553 --> 00:27:21.340
Coach is calling him.
- Come back.

00:27:23.056 --> 00:27:24.384
Come on.

00:27:24.544 --> 00:27:25.920
Hey!

00:27:27.075 --> 00:27:28.286
Rascal!

00:27:28.366 --> 00:27:29.656
We are getting late.

00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:30.825
You ruined it. Get lost.

00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:32.081
Meet me in the Cafe tonight.

00:27:39.573 --> 00:27:40.880
Bye.

00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:44.681
He does this every time.

00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:46.762
It's not enough to be a good player.
He needs to be disciplined.

00:27:47.023 --> 00:27:48.954
You always defend him.
Ask him where he was.

00:27:51.988 --> 00:27:55.627
I've seen many talented men like you

00:27:55.794 --> 00:27:58.714
but I haven't seen anyone
who made it big without discipline.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.712
I won't tolerate it if
you repeat this again. Go.

00:28:34.302 --> 00:28:39.770
I said I've seen many talented
men like him, that's a lie.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.074
I've never seen anybody
like him in my career.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.344
He's different.

00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:52.341
Dad, there's someone I love.

00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:57.528
I need to tell you something.

00:28:57.608 --> 00:28:58.630
Listen!
- Yes, sir?

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.817
Bring me the sauce.

00:29:00.504 --> 00:29:03.192
Pay attention.
I'm saying something very important.

00:29:03.272 --> 00:29:04.362
Tell me.

00:29:05.305 --> 00:29:07.342
I told my dad about us last night.

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:08.794
You told him?

00:29:09.896 --> 00:29:11.703
What's that reaction?

00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:14.824
What? You told him?

00:29:14.904 --> 00:29:17.117
Don't overdo it. Now pay attention.

00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:21.311
Please talk to dad once.

00:29:21.873 --> 00:29:24.317
Or else, it will be
difficult for me to meet you.

00:29:24.454 --> 00:29:26.203
What do I say at home every day?

00:29:27.604 --> 00:29:30.296
I don't know if I can
convince him for our wedding.

00:29:31.092 --> 00:29:33.527
If he sees you,
he'll definitely agree.

00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:42.590
Drink it.

00:29:43.086 --> 00:29:44.933
Open the bottle and drink all of it.

00:29:46.544 --> 00:29:48.453
I've discussing an
important matter with you

00:29:48.691 --> 00:29:50.365
and all you can
think of is the sauce.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.271
Look at me.
- No.

00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:12.600
Look at me.
- No.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.248
Listen to me, Sarah.

00:30:20.342 --> 00:30:21.906
Samosas are getting cold.

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:25.001
Let's...

00:30:25.329 --> 00:30:26.577
Get lost.

00:31:36.086 --> 00:31:38.577
No, I can't take him into my home.

00:31:38.804 --> 00:31:40.121
Dad, you don't even know him.

00:31:40.201 --> 00:31:41.211
Just give him a chance.

00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:44.173
Sarah, if my own daughter marries
a person from another religion

00:31:44.253 --> 00:31:45.839
how can I face people?

00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:48.894
Mr Paul, we are older ones.

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:50.764
If we think everything
through in a calm way

00:31:50.844 --> 00:31:52.170
everything will fall in place.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.130
We can't achieve
anything by being angry.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.764
Arjun has no family,
but I'm there for him.

00:31:56.844 --> 00:31:57.860
Ask him to convert.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.061
No, dad. He will not.
- Okay...

00:31:59.141 --> 00:32:01.579
No, I don't want Arjun
to change anything for me.

00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:03.109
But...
- I love him as he is.

00:32:03.189 --> 00:32:06.482
No, dear.
Calm down. He's your father.

00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:08.304
He just said it in his anger.

00:32:08.437 --> 00:32:10.020
Why are you so mad about him?

00:32:10.207 --> 00:32:11.907
He's a local cricketer after all.

00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:13.705
Nothing more.

00:32:14.155 --> 00:32:15.881
If he had any talent
he would've been selected

00:32:15.961 --> 00:32:17.016
in the national team by now.

00:32:17.096 --> 00:32:18.734
What did you say?

00:32:20.949 --> 00:32:21.972
Do you have any sense?

00:32:22.052 --> 00:32:23.256
What do you know about Arjun's game?

00:32:23.336 --> 00:32:25.045
What is this?
- Sir, let's go.

00:32:25.776 --> 00:32:27.972
How dare he!
What does he mean by that?

00:32:28.182 --> 00:32:29.630
Sarah, where are you going? Wait!
- Leave it.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:30.914
Arjun...

00:32:36.893 --> 00:32:37.987
Thanks.

00:32:47.848 --> 00:32:48.977
Are you going out of town?

00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:56.176
I'll go take a shower.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.590
Then we'll get married.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.748
What's that wound? What happened?

00:34:26.054 --> 00:34:31.147
Nothing.
I want to quit cricket, Sarah.

00:34:32.967 --> 00:34:36.742
How can you quit cricket?
It's your life.

00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:42.604
No, Sarah. I have you now.
That's enough for me.

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:49.343
Darling...

00:35:55.552 --> 00:35:58.226
Who is more important to you,
me or him?

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.965
You.

00:37:17.238 --> 00:37:18.243
Thank you.

00:37:19.553 --> 00:37:21.988
Don't forget to go
to the lawyer today.

00:37:26.451 --> 00:37:28.413
Getting lots of complaints nowadays.

00:37:28.493 --> 00:37:30.232
What's happening with you all?

00:37:31.795 --> 00:37:32.986
Good morning, sir!

00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:34.314
What's your shift time?

00:37:34.433 --> 00:37:35.584
8 o' clock, sir.

00:37:36.758 --> 00:37:38.812
What's the time now?
- I'm sorry, sir.

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:40.329
There was no electricity
at home last night.

00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:42.653
Deal with all your
personal problems at home.

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:44.712
If you can't solve them,
quit work and sit at home.

00:37:44.792 --> 00:37:47.453
I don't want to listen to any of
those things here. - Okay, sir.

00:37:47.631 --> 00:37:48.964
All of you, get back to your work.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.998
Ignore it, Sarah.
You know how he is.

00:37:58.612 --> 00:37:59.686
Yeah.

00:38:00.893 --> 00:38:01.961
Come.

00:38:04.745 --> 00:38:07.424
What's wrong? Another fight at home?

00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:13.224
We don't shout or scream
at each other at home.

00:38:13.707 --> 00:38:18.279
I shout, I feel bad, then I cry.

00:38:20.319 --> 00:38:22.909
He wasn't like this
before our wedding, Laxmi.

00:38:25.597 --> 00:38:28.253
Sometimes I feel responsible
for this change in him.

00:38:30.376 --> 00:38:32.081
My folks were
pressurizing me at home

00:38:32.621 --> 00:38:34.853
so I forced Arjun to marry me.

00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:38.992
As soon as we got married
and settled down he quit cricket.

00:38:39.392 --> 00:38:41.469
But later I realized

00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:46.372
that he didn't just quit cricket

00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:49.116
he stopped being the Arjun
that I fell in love with.

00:38:55.948 --> 00:38:58.959
One, two, three...

00:38:59.192 --> 00:39:01.987
There are 4 almonds in it.
You are very lucky.

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:05.658
I've been jobless for 2 years.

00:39:06.012 --> 00:39:07.794
We constantly fight
at home about it.

00:39:07.927 --> 00:39:09.422
I don't know any other work.

00:39:09.588 --> 00:39:10.657
But if I get 4 almonds
in the almond milk worth

00:39:10.737 --> 00:39:11.746
5 rupees I'm a very lucky man?

00:39:11.877 --> 00:39:14.527
Yes, man. I got only 3.

00:39:16.245 --> 00:39:17.319
Listen.
- Yes.

00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:19.930
I need some money.
I'll give them back in a month.

00:39:20.064 --> 00:39:22.264
You've a lot of
expectations from me, man.

00:39:22.517 --> 00:39:23.566
Do you know something?

00:39:23.646 --> 00:39:25.376
I don't have money to
pay for this almond milk too.

00:39:26.736 --> 00:39:27.962
You don't have money for it?
- No.

00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:29.223
Then why did you
call me to drink it?

00:39:29.303 --> 00:39:30.860
Don't be silly.
Just because the movie posters say

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.867
See it today, doesn't
mean you'll get free tickets.

00:39:32.947 --> 00:39:35.121
You need to spend money to buy them.
It's the same.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.132
Sir!

00:39:39.682 --> 00:39:40.885
Did you bring money?

00:39:41.072 --> 00:39:42.864
No, sir.
- Then why did you come?

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:45.661
Sir...

00:39:46.103 --> 00:39:49.252
This girl joined work
as my new assistant.

00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:52.691
My old assistant had
to take maternity leave.

00:39:52.771 --> 00:39:54.148
I didn't make her pregnant.

00:39:54.228 --> 00:39:56.240
I didn't even know
that she was married.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.694
The reason I'm telling you this is

00:39:57.899 --> 00:40:01.973
I met your friend when
that girl joined the job.

00:40:02.786 --> 00:40:05.742
I told him to arrange 50,000 rupees

00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:07.807
and I'll help him
to get his job back.

00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:10.126
I've been telling him for two years.

00:40:10.863 --> 00:40:13.293
But, he is a righteous man.
He doesn't want to do it.

00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:17.305
Sir, he doesn't have money
even to buy almond milk...

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:18.849
I told you that I
did nothing wrong, sir.

00:40:18.929 --> 00:40:20.744
I wasn't involved in it...
- Do you think that money is for me?

00:40:20.824 --> 00:40:22.607
There won't be anything left for me.
I need to pay the policemen

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:24.188
auditor, food inspector

00:40:24.268 --> 00:40:25.581
evidence room in-charge.

00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:27.518
After paying all of them,
I'll hardly have 10,000 left.

00:40:27.768 --> 00:40:31.078
Everybody that worked with you paid
the money and got their jobs back.

00:40:31.158 --> 00:40:33.637
But I don't know why
you still don't get it.

00:40:33.717 --> 00:40:34.736
Did you get it?

00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:35.824
Yes, sir.
- What?

00:40:35.904 --> 00:40:38.402
He lost his job because they
suspected him of taking bribes.

00:40:38.482 --> 00:40:40.610
Now he has to give a
bribe to get his job back.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.679
You've no money,
but have lots of attitude.

00:40:44.806 --> 00:40:46.035
Sir, my job.

00:40:51.021 --> 00:40:54.148
We've had three new
prime ministers this year.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.188
If they can lose their posts,
you can lose your job too.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.522
Man, why did you ask
me for money this morning?

00:41:13.523 --> 00:41:15.631
Why do you need
money all of a sudden?

00:41:17.507 --> 00:41:19.203
Come.

00:41:20.766 --> 00:41:22.326
Tomorrow is Nani's birthday.

00:41:23.229 --> 00:41:24.923
He asked me to buy a
jersey as a birthday gift.

00:41:26.478 --> 00:41:27.529
It costs 500 rupees.

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:30.623
Okay, jersey is the t-shirt
that cricketers wear, right?

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:33.849
Idiot. You should use friends
like me for such things.

00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:35.227
Come on, let's go to Koti.

00:41:36.052 --> 00:41:37.901
Who needs 500 rupees?

00:41:37.981 --> 00:41:40.076
We'll get a fantastic
jersey for 50 rupees.

00:41:40.156 --> 00:41:41.637
An exact copy of the original.

00:41:41.717 --> 00:41:43.857
Even Sachin Tendulkar can't
tell the difference. Let's go.

00:41:43.937 --> 00:41:45.681
Get down. I said get down.
- But...

00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:47.352
Man...

00:41:47.432 --> 00:41:49.234
Never give me such
stupid ideas again.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.817
He may not realize it,
but my heart knows what I gave him.

00:41:54.565 --> 00:41:56.142
Okay, I've another idea. Let's go.

00:41:57.346 --> 00:41:59.379
Let's go. I'll explain
it on the way. It's a good idea.

00:41:59.459 --> 00:42:00.610
Come on, start.

00:42:10.586 --> 00:42:11.587
Ask him.

00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:13.765
Hurry up, guys. I've work.

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:17.436
I need some money.
I'll give it back in a month.

00:42:17.516 --> 00:42:19.358
How much?
- 500 rupees.

00:42:19.535 --> 00:42:21.501
Is that it?
Then why did you hesitate so much?

00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:23.564
Nani's birthday.

00:42:23.985 --> 00:42:27.236
Did I ask you the reason?
You worry too much.

00:42:29.254 --> 00:42:30.950
I don't have that much cash.

00:42:31.578 --> 00:42:33.969
Do one thing. Go home and
take from Paddu. I'll call her.

00:42:34.049 --> 00:42:37.064
Paddu? There was a big
fight last time. It's okay.

00:42:37.144 --> 00:42:39.813
She said those things
because she didn't know us.

00:42:39.893 --> 00:42:41.744
Don't worry.
Go take it from her. I'll call her.

00:42:41.824 --> 00:42:44.972
Let's do one thing.
I'll take it from you tomorrow.

00:42:45.242 --> 00:42:47.301
I'm going to a camp tonight.

00:42:47.878 --> 00:42:49.813
Take it day after tomorrow.
I'll be in the bank.

00:42:49.893 --> 00:42:52.204
No need. Call her right now.
We'll take it from her.

00:42:52.284 --> 00:42:53.303
Let's go.
- But...

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.074
Come to our sport after
you come back from the camp.

00:42:55.154 --> 00:42:56.229
Let's go.
- Bye.

00:43:00.225 --> 00:43:01.509
Should we ask Paddu again?

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.522
Who will dare to go inside
and ask Paddu for money?

00:43:10.095 --> 00:43:12.419
Why is everyone looking at me?
I won't go.

00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:14.508
Please, man.

00:43:14.901 --> 00:43:16.816
Why are you trapping me?

00:43:16.896 --> 00:43:18.654
I don't know why
they named her Paddu.

00:43:18.734 --> 00:43:20.220
She literally keeps
account of everything.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.197
Please, man.

00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:24.444
Don't you remember what
a mess I made last time?

00:43:24.524 --> 00:43:27.344
Same story. Anil went out
of town and we came here for...

00:43:27.424 --> 00:43:30.111
Not every day is the same.
Think positive.

00:43:33.997 --> 00:43:36.804
Okay. I'll ask her.
But you've to come with me.

00:43:43.986 --> 00:43:45.912
Looks like it is your lucky day.

00:43:45.992 --> 00:43:47.984
I think she'll give you
money without making a scene.

00:43:48.293 --> 00:43:49.771
Do you think she'll
really give the money?

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:51.698
Yes. She might be counting it.

00:44:09.317 --> 00:44:10.319
Is it nice?

00:44:10.399 --> 00:44:12.445
Right. You don't have
money when I ask you.

00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:16.103
But you always have money to give
it to your friends to eat and drink.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:18.347
Where did you keep it?
I can't see it.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.191
They owe us 10,000 rupees already.

00:44:22.271 --> 00:44:25.696
Rajesh owes us 5,500.
Now he wants another 500?

00:44:25.776 --> 00:44:29.715
Do they think this is a
bank to withdraw money any time?

00:44:29.795 --> 00:44:34.368
A bank has fixed timings.
So what if they hear me?

00:44:34.448 --> 00:44:35.602
Do you think I care?

00:44:35.682 --> 00:44:37.470
I gave them a nice
scolding the other day

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:38.950
but they are here
again without shame.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.780
But you don't want
me to say a single word.

00:44:42.718 --> 00:44:46.216
Yes, I got the money.
Okay, I'll call you later.

00:44:55.937 --> 00:44:58.738
Why did she say 5,500
when I owe them only 5,000?

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:04.451
Do you think she counted the
500 they gave me on my wedding day?

00:45:06.898 --> 00:45:09.079
Okay, everyone remove
what they have.

00:45:11.813 --> 00:45:13.811
5...
- Give it to me.

00:45:16.368 --> 00:45:18.211
You are all sorted
for tonight, my man.

00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:19.384
You can buy a quarter bottle of rum

00:45:19.464 --> 00:45:20.613
and half a pack of
cigarettes with this money.

00:45:20.693 --> 00:45:22.174
Have a drink and
forget your worries.

00:45:22.749 --> 00:45:23.784
Take it.

00:45:24.344 --> 00:45:25.711
Oh my!

00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:31.844
Where have you been?

00:45:31.924 --> 00:45:34.224
I've been searching
for you since evening.

00:45:35.338 --> 00:45:36.915
You are very lucky.

00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:39.821
I told him that when I
counted the almonds this morning.

00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:41.221
Come to the point.

00:45:42.024 --> 00:45:44.055
Hyderabad Club versus New Zealand.

00:45:44.338 --> 00:45:46.253
I told you about the
charity match, right?

00:45:47.343 --> 00:45:49.568
I spoke about it yesterday
while having tea.

00:45:49.648 --> 00:45:53.465
A batsman spot is vacant
in Hyderabad Club Team.

00:45:53.603 --> 00:45:54.771
I spoke to them.

00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:56.260
About what?

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.922
It was very difficult.

00:45:58.121 --> 00:46:00.639
But they agreed since
it is a charity match.

00:46:00.822 --> 00:46:02.100
Otherwise there was no chance.

00:46:02.754 --> 00:46:04.376
I don't understand
what you are saying.

00:46:06.739 --> 00:46:08.073
You are playing tomorrow.

00:46:13.159 --> 00:46:15.551
All the board members
will see tomorrow's match.

00:46:16.205 --> 00:46:18.463
Once they see you in action

00:46:18.604 --> 00:46:21.892
they will definitely
make you the assistant coach.

00:46:22.118 --> 00:46:24.211
After that you can happily
do what you like to do.

00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:27.538
Sir, wait a minute.
I respect you a lot.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.978
And thank you so much
for working so hard for me.

00:46:30.058 --> 00:46:32.469
You mean you don't want to play?

00:46:32.817 --> 00:46:34.843
Do you realize what
you are rejecting?

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.035
I don't want to go back there, sir.

00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:41.590
Listen to me.
This is the right job for you.

00:46:43.394 --> 00:46:46.776
I'm still an assistant
coach at this age.

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:51.281
But with your talent,
you can become the main coach.

00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:53.030
I understood everything.
I'll talk to him.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.333
Come with me.
- What...

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:56.523
What are you trying to do?

00:46:56.603 --> 00:47:00.280
I've an idea. Mr Murthy
will surely have money. Ask him.

00:47:00.826 --> 00:47:01.872
No, I can't do that.

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:05.702
It's okay.
It won't be worse than asking Paddu.

00:47:06.007 --> 00:47:08.664
Ask him 600 rupees.
- Why 600?

00:47:08.744 --> 00:47:10.832
100 bucks for us for
tagging along since morning.

00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:14.430
Nobody has a bigger reason
than you to play tomorrow's match.

00:47:15.274 --> 00:47:19.917
Others play such matches
for the 1,000 rupee match fee.

00:47:21.618 --> 00:47:24.683
But nobody has real
interest in the game.

00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:29.202
Mr Murthy, I convinced him.

00:47:29.282 --> 00:47:30.343
You convinced him?
- Yes.

00:47:30.423 --> 00:47:32.731
He agreed?
- Yes. He agreed.

00:47:33.181 --> 00:47:36.378
You didn't agree when I spoke to you

00:47:36.458 --> 00:47:38.267
but you listened to this idiot.

00:47:39.416 --> 00:47:41.478
But it's okay.
- But sir...

00:47:43.845 --> 00:47:45.934
Go home, take your
kit and come to the ground.

00:47:46.162 --> 00:47:47.864
Sir...
- I'll change and come.

00:47:48.012 --> 00:47:49.322
We'll practice two hours.

00:47:51.472 --> 00:47:52.690
Don't worry about it.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.341
They won't telecast the
match on national television.

00:47:54.421 --> 00:47:56.628
Just go and hit a square
cut and a cover drive.

00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:59.567
We'll get 1,000 rupees.
500 for you and 500 for us.

00:47:59.932 --> 00:48:01.243
Shall we go?
- Yes.

00:48:01.426 --> 00:48:03.662
Come soon. We'll wait at the ground.

00:48:03.742 --> 00:48:06.098
Hurry up. 500 for us, right?
- Let's go.

00:48:09.454 --> 00:48:10.832
Dad!

00:48:12.113 --> 00:48:14.670
Mom and I are here.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.899
We are inviting aunt
for my birthday tomorrow.

00:49:10.204 --> 00:49:13.420
Wow! An SG bat! Is it yours, dad?

00:49:13.847 --> 00:49:15.712
Where's mom?
- She's coming.

00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:23.432
Where are you going?

00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:24.695
Backyard.

00:49:33.683 --> 00:49:36.135
Hurry up. Mom is coming.

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:38.105
Come on, hurry up.

00:49:43.563 --> 00:49:45.412
Nani, will you drink Horlicks?
- No.

00:49:45.606 --> 00:49:51.043
[cricket playing on television]

00:49:51.265 --> 00:49:53.894
Let me come with you, dad, please.

00:49:53.974 --> 00:49:55.942
No, I'll get very late.
You go to sleep.

00:49:56.115 --> 00:49:58.592
Please, dad. Let me come.

00:49:58.672 --> 00:50:02.718
I've never seen you bat.
Please, dad, please.

00:50:02.798 --> 00:50:03.890
No.

00:50:05.768 --> 00:50:07.417
Sarah, I'm going
to a movie with Rajesh.

00:50:07.497 --> 00:50:09.852
Movie? I want to come too.

00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:13.689
Please, dad, please.
- Take him along.

00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:15.488
He has a holiday tomorrow.
- Please, dad, please.

00:50:15.568 --> 00:50:19.293
Please, dad, please, please, please.

00:50:19.373 --> 00:50:21.978
Okay, come on.
- Yeah!

00:50:27.684 --> 00:50:29.312
Who's that? You rascal!

00:50:33.198 --> 00:50:35.196
What does rascal mean?

00:50:35.276 --> 00:50:36.895
It means all the best.

00:50:36.975 --> 00:50:38.073
Oh.

00:51:32.716 --> 00:51:35.036
There's a place where
your dad and I go often.

00:51:35.163 --> 00:51:36.580
I'll take you there. Come on.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.644
Yeah! Let's go!

00:53:46.596 --> 00:53:48.937
Thank you, mom!
- Oh.

00:53:49.246 --> 00:53:52.913
Good morning, birthday boy.
Happy birthday.

00:53:54.595 --> 00:53:56.131
How's the toy?

00:53:57.956 --> 00:54:00.646
Hey, listen. Brush your teeth.
Go and hurry up, okay?

00:54:00.807 --> 00:54:02.002
I'll keep this there.

00:54:10.067 --> 00:54:11.451
Wow!

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.868
Happy birthday.

00:54:12.948 --> 00:54:14.385
Thank you, dad!

00:54:17.574 --> 00:54:18.990
After the match,
on our way back home

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.592
we'll stop at uncle's
shot to buy the jersey.

00:54:21.979 --> 00:54:23.247
Really?

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:26.850
I made dal and curry.
Cook rice one hour before eating.

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.151
Okay?

00:54:47.533 --> 00:54:48.784
All the best!

00:54:49.038 --> 00:54:50.572
Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Nani.

00:54:56.401 --> 00:54:58.552
Hey... Stop it... Stop it...

00:54:58.632 --> 00:55:00.575
Stop! Now dance!

00:55:02.972 --> 00:55:05.744
Stop! Let's go. Let's go.

00:55:06.408 --> 00:55:08.107
Some new player.
- Really?

00:55:13.698 --> 00:55:14.949
Now stop.

00:55:15.115 --> 00:55:17.384
Arjun, you haven't met him, right?

00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:20.500
Nandu. No. 1 batsman in the club.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.778
Arjun. Ex Ranji player.
I'm sure you heard about him.

00:55:24.535 --> 00:55:25.601
I didn't.

00:55:27.504 --> 00:55:28.604
Then remember it.

00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:31.186
He might be the assistant
coach in our club very soon.

00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:33.351
Oh. Is he playing?

00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:36.905
Where were you hiding till now?

00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:39.053
Were you sitting and waiting
for Gavaskar to retire?

00:55:42.145 --> 00:55:43.985
By the way, you said he
might be the assistant coach.

00:55:44.065 --> 00:55:45.533
I hope there's no
danger to your position.

00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:52.995
If he focuses fully on the game your
position will be gone, not mine.

00:55:54.813 --> 00:55:59.623
Stop it, guys.
I said stop it. Go to your seats.

00:55:59.961 --> 00:56:02.358
Nani, go sit with them.
- Okay.

00:56:02.498 --> 00:56:04.911
It's a big match for
Hyderabad Cricket Association.

00:56:04.991 --> 00:56:08.151
Hey, John Spearman! Look!

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:11.297
So, Hyderabad versus
New Zealand at LB Stadium.

00:56:11.377 --> 00:56:12.554
Let's head to the toss.

00:56:12.948 --> 00:56:14.132
Shall we?
- Yes.

00:56:15.698 --> 00:56:17.270
Tails.
- That's tails.

00:56:17.863 --> 00:56:20.171
You won the toss.
- I think we'd like to bat.

00:56:21.197 --> 00:56:22.215
Good luck!
- Okay.

00:56:22.295 --> 00:56:24.394
The atmosphere today at
the stadium is unbelievable.

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:26.964
John Spearman,
captain of the New Zealand Team

00:56:27.044 --> 00:56:29.439
presenting a cheque to
the chairman of Hope Foundation.

00:56:29.631 --> 00:56:31.132
The money would
be going towards the

00:56:31.212 --> 00:56:33.195
under privileged children
for their education.

00:56:34.079 --> 00:56:36.276
Look at that!
Beautiful as they walk out.

00:56:38.893 --> 00:56:41.952
Spearman and Andrew are opening
the batting for New Zealand.

00:56:42.364 --> 00:56:44.140
They would like to use
this match to get used to

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.628
the conditions
of the sub-continent.

00:56:45.708 --> 00:56:48.517
Almost like a practice match
for New Zealand this must be.

00:56:48.597 --> 00:56:50.171
Hyderabad would like
to give a tough fight

00:56:50.251 --> 00:56:51.298
this being their home ground.

00:56:51.378 --> 00:56:53.008
John Spearman opening
the batting and

00:56:53.088 --> 00:56:55.388
Nivas ready to bowl
the first ball now.

00:56:56.124 --> 00:56:57.724
Watch it. Watch it.
- That's driven

00:56:58.021 --> 00:56:59.576
handsomely to the off side.

00:56:59.656 --> 00:57:01.169
First boundary coming
of the first ball.

00:57:01.249 --> 00:57:02.398
New Zealand, on the mark.

00:57:02.478 --> 00:57:03.892
Hyderabad giving away runs.

00:57:03.972 --> 00:57:07.313
Oh, that's a bold shot again done
brilliantly, and that's a four.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.696
Let's see if these
fireworks continue.

00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:16.257
Here he goes again. That's a six.

00:57:17.081 --> 00:57:19.711
Wonderful! Really wonderful!

00:57:20.605 --> 00:57:21.641
Brilliant!

00:57:26.585 --> 00:57:29.599
Here he goes again.
Bang out of the ground.

00:57:30.954 --> 00:57:32.973
Hyderabad doesn't
look pleased at all.

00:57:33.053 --> 00:57:34.638
They haven't got a
single breakthrough yet.

00:57:34.718 --> 00:57:37.879
Listen, ask him to
cover up those drums.

00:57:38.065 --> 00:57:39.708
We won't need them today.

00:57:45.178 --> 00:57:46.828
New Zealanders have
been having a run party.

00:57:46.908 --> 00:57:48.505
They are only dealing
with boundaries.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.387
Andrew going in for the big hits.

00:57:50.597 --> 00:57:53.923
And that's a boundary too
which brings up to 50 for Andrew.

00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:57.037
What an innings this has been!
The coach is very happy.

00:58:01.089 --> 00:58:03.076
That's it! Oh, yes!

00:58:03.969 --> 00:58:05.924
That's brilliant timing!

00:58:06.004 --> 00:58:07.557
He's the man.

00:58:08.193 --> 00:58:10.052
Good throw, dad!

00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:16.568
Come on!

00:58:20.348 --> 00:58:21.905
Catch it!
- He hasn't timed that one.

00:58:21.985 --> 00:58:23.054
Gone straight to Nandan Reddy.

00:58:23.134 --> 00:58:25.007
For a second it looked
like he dropped it.

00:58:25.087 --> 00:58:26.161
First wicket for Hyderabad.

00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:28.059
New Zealand setting
a big total here.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.293
That's a grand total
set by New Zealand

00:58:33.373 --> 00:58:34.409
and more runs are
being added to the total.

00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:35.576
Hit straight for a six.

00:58:35.656 --> 00:58:37.369
Hyderabad has a huge
task at their hands.

00:58:37.449 --> 00:58:39.495
They need to hit
332 to win the match.

00:58:39.726 --> 00:58:41.962
Should I get the drums?
- Not yet. Wait.

00:58:42.822 --> 00:58:43.946
Hi!

00:58:46.775 --> 00:58:48.843
Pitch is too bouncy.
They are hitting all boundaries.

00:58:48.923 --> 00:58:50.929
So, boys.
At least give them a tough fight.

00:58:51.054 --> 00:58:52.754
Don't go down so easily, okay?

00:58:52.834 --> 00:58:54.803
We need 6.5 runs per over.

00:58:54.883 --> 00:58:57.125
Nandu, do well.
Keep going. Keep going.

00:58:57.205 --> 00:58:58.533
Sir.
- Yes?

00:58:58.613 --> 00:59:00.038
Arjun is a good player.

00:59:00.118 --> 00:59:01.176
Shall we send him
in the first round?

00:59:01.256 --> 00:59:03.564
Oh. Will you join in the next round?

00:59:03.687 --> 00:59:05.418
Boys, get going. Get going.

00:59:05.622 --> 00:59:07.663
And I want all the
boys to play well.

00:59:08.666 --> 00:59:09.815
Okay now?

00:59:12.266 --> 00:59:14.469
Huge responsibility
on the two opening batsman.

00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:15.620
Nandan and Srikanth.

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.512
Hyderabad needs a good start.

00:59:17.592 --> 00:59:19.096
They should make
the most of the field

00:59:19.176 --> 00:59:20.838
restrictions in the first 15 overs.

00:59:21.185 --> 00:59:23.859
First ball.
That crosses the boundary.

00:59:23.939 --> 00:59:25.638
Good shot!

00:59:27.865 --> 00:59:28.889
Good shot.

00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:30.178
James Wheeler in attack.

00:59:30.258 --> 00:59:31.333
Oh, that hits the pad.

00:59:31.413 --> 00:59:33.515
New Zealand appeals
and up goes the finger.

00:59:33.595 --> 00:59:35.562
Hyderabad loses its first
wicket quite early in the match.

00:59:35.642 --> 00:59:36.674
Sir.
- Yes?

00:59:36.754 --> 00:59:38.373
Send Arjun for batting...
- Oh God!

00:59:38.453 --> 00:59:40.346
Mr Murthy, don't start again.
- Captain!

00:59:40.426 --> 00:59:42.377
Required run rate is rising
and the captain of Hyderabad

00:59:42.457 --> 00:59:43.470
Ravinder comes in.

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:45.861
That's timed sweetly and
the ball goes to the boundary.

00:59:48.008 --> 00:59:49.319
That's wonderful.

00:59:49.399 --> 00:59:50.937
Ball is racing to the boundary.

00:59:51.017 --> 00:59:52.871
50 partnership between
Nandan and Ravinder.

00:59:52.951 --> 00:59:55.043
Nandan 2 runs away
from a half century.

00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:59.044
That's hit to the leg
side and that's a boundary.

00:59:59.124 --> 01:00:01.335
Nandan Reddy completes
a half century.

01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:04.566
Sir, are you playing?

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.693
Then I'll go get all our guys.

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.455
Oh, that's a hard hit.

01:00:15.535 --> 01:00:18.339
The fielder gets a finger on
it but the ball goes to the ground.

01:00:18.652 --> 01:00:20.255
Should I play the drums now?

01:00:20.335 --> 01:00:21.946
Wait. I'll tell you when to play.
Just wait.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:25.555
Goes again.
Ball is in the air he should get it.

01:00:25.711 --> 01:00:26.849
It's caught.

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:28.430
Hyderabad loses a second wicket and

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:29.953
captain Ravinder walks
back to the pavilion.

01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:31.354
I told you.

01:00:31.553 --> 01:00:33.846
Sir... Sir...

01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:34.998
If another wicket falls...

01:00:35.078 --> 01:00:37.832
If you trouble me like this,
I'll walk out of the ground.

01:00:37.912 --> 01:00:39.805
Please. I can't take it.

01:00:40.382 --> 01:00:41.954
New Zealand seems
to be in control here.

01:00:42.034 --> 01:00:44.261
And that's bowled.
Can you believe that?

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:47.375
Hyderabad loses another wicket.
What bowling!

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.778
Sir! Send him.

01:00:54.928 --> 01:00:56.416
Yes! Arjun, come on, pad up.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.431
Sorry.

01:01:24.242 --> 01:01:26.431
Wheeler has got two wickets
in the last two balls.

01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:27.632
He's on a hatrick.

01:01:27.932 --> 01:01:29.374
Let's see if he can do it.

01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:32.036
Arjun is the new batsman at No.
5 for Hyderabad.

01:01:32.178 --> 01:01:34.081
36 year old and ex Ranji player and

01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:35.441
facing the hatrick delivery.

01:01:35.521 --> 01:01:37.776
Can he save Hyderabad
from embarrassment?

01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:46.057
Wheeler running to bowl.
Will he get another wicket?

01:01:46.775 --> 01:01:49.510
Oh, that's a hit. What a stroke!

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.268
Denying a hatrick to Wheeler,
ball races to the boundary.

01:01:53.946 --> 01:01:55.828
Good shot, dad!

01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:59.305
That is as good as anything
from anybody at any time.

01:01:59.504 --> 01:02:02.222
Not an easy ball to play.
But he actually middles it.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:05.344
Come on, boys. - Can Wheeler
get a wicket this time?

01:02:05.509 --> 01:02:07.862
Oh, he has hit it straight.
That's a good shot!

01:02:07.942 --> 01:02:09.826
And the ball is racing
to the boundary.

01:02:13.845 --> 01:02:15.744
Hit the next ball and show me, mate.

01:02:16.258 --> 01:02:18.146
Come on, man. Send him back.

01:02:18.788 --> 01:02:20.642
But Wheeler is an
experienced bowler.

01:02:20.722 --> 01:02:22.464
It's not that easy to attack him.

01:02:22.544 --> 01:02:25.916
I'm sure Wheeler is going
to answer back definitely

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:27.693
with his next ball.

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:37.421
Last ball of this
over goes to Wheeler.

01:02:37.677 --> 01:02:43.260
Gone for a full toss and
that has been hit high in the air...

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.405
Yes!

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.899
Arjun!

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:53.168
Bro! Now get the drums out.

01:02:53.248 --> 01:02:54.608
Go ahead.

01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:57.998
Wonderful.

01:02:58.078 --> 01:02:59.320
What a shot!

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.573
Brilliant.

01:03:02.643 --> 01:03:03.886
And again.

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:05.547
Well played.

01:03:07.123 --> 01:03:09.590
It's going, going and gone.

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:11.834
Oh, what a performance
this is already

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:13.418
thanks to this man Arjun.

01:03:16.606 --> 01:03:19.794
But it all depends on
these two players on the field.

01:03:22.597 --> 01:03:23.815
Chakri hits another shot.

01:03:23.895 --> 01:03:26.631
50 partnership for Arjun and
Chakri bringing hope to Hyderabad.

01:03:26.711 --> 01:03:30.696
Oh, he smashes it again.
The ball races to the boundary.

01:03:30.909 --> 01:03:33.610
And it's a four.

01:03:36.735 --> 01:03:39.547
Hyderabad needs just
45 runs in 30 balls.

01:03:40.472 --> 01:03:42.044
That's a four again.

01:03:42.124 --> 01:03:44.133
Change of bowling.
He's going front foot

01:03:44.213 --> 01:03:45.531
misses it and that's out.

01:03:45.611 --> 01:03:47.965
Chakravarti walking
back to the pavilion.

01:03:48.045 --> 01:03:49.664
New batsman for Hyderabad.

01:03:50.301 --> 01:03:51.696
Come on, mate.

01:03:51.834 --> 01:03:53.760
Come on, boys. Let's get another.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.816
Bowled him. That's a nice strike.

01:03:56.896 --> 01:03:59.159
The game now slipping
away from Hyderabad.

01:04:01.056 --> 01:04:02.792
Oh, that's bowled again.

01:04:03.278 --> 01:04:04.473
Hyderabad now in trouble.

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:06.678
8 wickets down. Vittal walks back.

01:04:07.204 --> 01:04:09.219
Change of bowling.
Praveen, the new batsman.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.475
Hit it in the air.
There's a man out there...

01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:13.374
Catch it! Catch it!
- Will he be able to catch it?

01:04:13.454 --> 01:04:16.042
And... Yes, he caught the ball.

01:04:16.122 --> 01:04:17.758
Hyderabad loses its 9th wicket.

01:04:19.195 --> 01:04:20.792
Now this game is getting
really interesting.

01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:22.281
It's getting really close.

01:04:22.361 --> 01:04:24.579
Hyderabad needs 18
runs from just 9 balls.

01:04:24.659 --> 01:04:25.659
Arjun on strike.

01:04:25.791 --> 01:04:27.590
That's front foot,
he hits it in the air

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.971
and the ball flies above the
fielder into the stands for a six.

01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:32.218
Now just 12 runs
needed from 8 balls.

01:04:32.298 --> 01:04:34.748
2 balls left of the over.
He goes again.

01:04:34.828 --> 01:04:37.462
It goes high into the air.
Is it caught? No, that's a six.

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:39.534
Yes, come on!

01:04:39.614 --> 01:04:42.368
Catch it! Come on, run!

01:04:44.503 --> 01:04:45.812
It looks like this
man Arjun is going

01:04:45.892 --> 01:04:47.212
to finish off this
match in this over.

01:04:47.292 --> 01:04:49.587
Last ball of the over.
Here he goes again.

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:52.620
It's a massive hit.
Is it going to be a six?

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.078
Just short of the boundary,
it's a four.

01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:00.078
Hyderabad just needs 2 runs.
This is nail biting.

01:05:02.049 --> 01:05:03.882
Come on, boys. Nice and sharp, yeah.

01:05:03.962 --> 01:05:05.079
Fielders closing in the circle.

01:05:05.159 --> 01:05:07.100
First ball of the last over.
Trick shot.

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.766
Serve another one.

01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:17.996
Just 2 runs needed from 4 balls.

01:05:18.076 --> 01:05:20.100
Pressure building, third ball.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.389
Now only 3 deliveries remain.

01:05:22.469 --> 01:05:24.791
Hyderabad so close, yet so far.

01:05:24.871 --> 01:05:26.216
We need to make 2 runs in 3 balls.

01:05:26.838 --> 01:05:28.228
Try to do it. Don't panic.

01:05:32.854 --> 01:05:35.685
Can he take a single and
give back the strike to Arjun?

01:05:38.104 --> 01:05:39.565
Yes, he connects the ball this time.

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:41.121
No, no, no!
- Arjun says no!

01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:42.394
Go, go, go back!

01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:44.604
Sahil is going back. Will he be out?

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:47.258
And New Zealand misses
a chance to finish off the game.

01:05:47.338 --> 01:05:48.563
No one seems happy.

01:05:48.643 --> 01:05:50.481
A terrible misunderstanding
from Sahil.

01:05:52.038 --> 01:05:53.482
Just 2 balls remaining.

01:05:53.986 --> 01:05:55.337
He has connected the ball.

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:57.657
Are they going to go for a run?
- No, no!

01:05:57.737 --> 01:06:01.439
The fielder picks it up.
The ball is thrown towards Arjun.

01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:03.781
Is he going to make it?

01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:07.187
Yes!
- That's a run out!

01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:09.594
Hyderabad cannot believe it.
New Zealand relieved.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.716
They have won the match.
A brilliant over by Wheeler.

01:06:12.796 --> 01:06:14.603
Such a close match for Hyderabad.

01:06:14.683 --> 01:06:16.397
Yes, they almost won the match.

01:06:16.741 --> 01:06:18.623
Hyderabad couldn't
have lost this match after

01:06:18.703 --> 01:06:20.406
such an amazing innings by Arjun.

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.802
Yes, he came in when
there was no hope left.

01:06:22.882 --> 01:06:25.166
He must be thinking
If only I got that single.

01:06:25.246 --> 01:06:27.435
New Zealand team
appreciating his efforts.

01:06:27.515 --> 01:06:30.193
Yes, this man deserves
all the applause.

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:32.167
Well done, Arjun.

01:06:58.576 --> 01:07:00.148
Super!

01:07:01.292 --> 01:07:02.859
He played so well.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.501
Let's meet the committee members.

01:07:12.358 --> 01:07:14.147
I think they will want
to give you a cheque.

01:07:14.227 --> 01:07:16.626
Please ask for cash, even
if it's a bit difficult to count.

01:07:17.282 --> 01:07:19.996
You won't have that trouble.
This is a charity match.

01:07:20.076 --> 01:07:21.351
We won't get a single rupee.

01:07:21.431 --> 01:07:23.135
No? - They will give
everything to charity.

01:07:23.215 --> 01:07:26.093
Charity? - You are pulling
Rajesh's leg, right?

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:27.993
Why would I pull his leg?

01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.431
The players' fees,
tickets, sponsorship

01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:33.431
everything will
go to Hope Foundation.

01:07:34.532 --> 01:07:36.310
It's a charity match.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.444
Otherwise why would New
Zealand Team play with our club?

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:43.589
Let's go. There is no change in you.

01:07:43.804 --> 01:07:46.004
Your technique, balance and flow

01:07:46.142 --> 01:07:48.114
it's exactly the
same as 10 years ago.

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.507
All the committee members
are talking about you.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.684
The assistant coach's
job is in your bag.

01:07:53.878 --> 01:07:55.827
You played brilliantly, Arjun.
- Stop it, sir!

01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:58.528
Why do you like to torture me?

01:07:59.298 --> 01:08:01.983
Don't you get it? I don't
have place for cricket in my life.

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:05.132
I don't want cricket,
or this assistant coach's job.

01:08:07.341 --> 01:08:09.261
The man before you
is not the cricketer Arjun.

01:08:09.427 --> 01:08:10.573
I have a wife and a son...

01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:17.277
Arjun!

01:08:19.187 --> 01:08:20.227
Nani, let's go.

01:08:20.307 --> 01:08:23.471
Dad, your kit! Dad, your kit!

01:08:24.043 --> 01:08:27.331
Why didn't you tell me
before that you play so well?

01:08:27.458 --> 01:08:30.209
Your square cuts were too good, dad.

01:08:36.585 --> 01:08:38.058
Yeah!

01:08:38.302 --> 01:08:40.239
Dad, we crossed uncle's shop.

01:08:40.411 --> 01:08:43.737
Dad! Dad! We crossed it!

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:48.126
Dad! Will you buy the
jersey from somewhere else?

01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:52.141
Answer me, dad. Answer me.

01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:56.009
Dad, jersey.
Dad, jersey. Dad, jersey.

01:08:56.089 --> 01:08:58.339
Have you gone mad?
- Dad, jersey. Dad...

01:09:08.338 --> 01:09:10.042
Hi, Karthik.
- Bye, daddy.

01:09:10.367 --> 01:09:11.518
Come.

01:09:13.678 --> 01:09:15.111
Okay.

01:09:15.477 --> 01:09:17.413
Why are you sitting here?

01:09:17.493 --> 01:09:18.943
Please welcome the
guests and make them sit.

01:09:22.441 --> 01:09:24.855
I already ate two chocolates.

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:28.564
Hey... What happened?
How did you get hurt?

01:09:34.853 --> 01:09:37.108
I got hit by a ball this morning.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:41.673
Did he have to play
cricket today as well?

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:47.167
My poor baby got
hurt on his birthday.

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.981
Sarah just went inside, Arjun.

01:10:45.938 --> 01:10:47.427
Were you looking for me?

01:11:04.262 --> 01:11:08.659
Take these also
and go sell them. Go.

01:11:10.327 --> 01:11:13.095
Were you stealing from
your wife in your own home?

01:11:14.442 --> 01:11:16.916
Every time I think that
you can't stoop any lower

01:11:16.996 --> 01:11:18.306
you prove me wrong.

01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:22.495
I've been strict with
money because I thought that

01:11:22.575 --> 01:11:24.981
if I save 1,000 rupees
from my salary every month

01:11:25.061 --> 01:11:27.145
we can pay the lawyer
and get your job back.

01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:31.970
How can we live if you
keep quitting like this in life?

01:11:32.572 --> 01:11:33.799
How?

01:11:35.345 --> 01:11:39.104
Every time I see you
being so disinterested in life

01:11:39.305 --> 01:11:42.515
you make me think that
this is all my fault.

01:11:47.347 --> 01:11:49.274
I can't sleep at nights.

01:11:55.777 --> 01:11:58.351
I'm talking to you. Say something.

01:12:10.405 --> 01:12:11.543
Did you see that?

01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:14.902
You give up and you
walk away every single time.

01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:17.532
You are doing the same
thing with your life too.

01:12:19.054 --> 01:12:21.938
Every time you get hurt,
you run away.

01:12:23.559 --> 01:12:26.460
I'm afraid that someday
you will find it difficult

01:12:26.738 --> 01:12:29.334
to live with me and leave me.

01:13:03.122 --> 01:13:04.782
When mom asked you how you got hurt

01:13:05.568 --> 01:13:07.007
why didn't you tell
her that I hit you?

01:13:08.705 --> 01:13:12.900
She will think that
I'm telling lies.

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:18.164
Nobody will believe that you hit me.

01:13:41.867 --> 01:13:43.749
Okay, you go home.

01:13:44.247 --> 01:13:46.205
Come soon, dad.

01:14:00.568 --> 01:14:03.260
Kiran! Come on!
Come on, keep playing.

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:10.434
How dare you shout at me?

01:14:13.447 --> 01:14:17.432
In the past I would've made
you run 10 rounds of the ground.

01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:27.699
I'm your father's age.

01:14:27.974 --> 01:14:31.018
But I smoke with you,
so that makes us friends.

01:14:31.163 --> 01:14:34.749
Don't worry about it.
I already forgot about it.

01:14:34.829 --> 01:14:36.138
You are right, sir.

01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:39.449
I can't live outside this rope.

01:14:40.733 --> 01:14:44.779
I knew it. I knew it.
You were born for this game.

01:14:45.304 --> 01:14:46.777
We'll meet Mr Ramaraju tomorrow.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:50.663
If you can get the assistant
coach's position it will be great.

01:14:51.188 --> 01:14:53.389
The salary is less,
but you will love the job.

01:14:53.469 --> 01:14:54.536
Not a coach, sir.

01:14:55.798 --> 01:14:56.798
A player.

01:14:57.382 --> 01:14:59.313
Player?
- You heard right.

01:15:03.814 --> 01:15:04.912
I want to play again.

01:15:07.379 --> 01:15:08.690
I want to play for the Indian Team.

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:17.291
Arjun, look...
- I don't want to die every day.

01:15:18.402 --> 01:15:20.222
You are 36 years old now, Arjun.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:23.171
That's the retiring
age in professional sports.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.533
I found myself when I was

01:15:24.613 --> 01:15:26.406
searching for 500 rupees
in the last 3 days.

01:15:27.366 --> 01:15:29.088
I saw the past 36 years of my life.

01:15:31.802 --> 01:15:33.298
I didn't understand
myself in all these years

01:15:33.378 --> 01:15:34.476
but I finally found
myself in the last 3 days.

01:15:34.556 --> 01:15:36.676
No, sir. I don't want this life.

01:15:38.512 --> 01:15:40.151
Even though you have
the desire to play

01:15:41.087 --> 01:15:42.958
you are physically
unfit to compete, Arjun.

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.973
I've been disappointing
every person who believed in me

01:15:48.053 --> 01:15:49.988
and believed that
I'll achieve something

01:15:53.574 --> 01:15:55.398
great in my life.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:03.655
You, Sarah, my friends, everyone.

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:11.639
Do you know when I finally
walked with my head held high again?

01:16:15.776 --> 01:16:19.339
This morning. When I came
out of the ground after the match.

01:16:21.857 --> 01:16:23.255
When I saw my son there.

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:27.649
There.

01:16:33.284 --> 01:16:34.662
I will do anything you ask of me.

01:16:36.837 --> 01:16:38.287
But I don't want
to bend my head again.

01:16:53.726 --> 01:16:56.731
I'll start my life again
which stopped 10 years ago.

01:16:59.271 --> 01:17:03.599
I'll do whatever it takes
to be in the Indian cricket team.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:58.128
He's not the coach,
I think he's a player. Sit down.

01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:00.058
How can he be a player?

01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:03.068
Good stroke.

01:19:03.148 --> 01:19:04.486
Did Coach come? What did he say?

01:19:04.566 --> 01:19:05.725
He hasn't come yet.
- Am I late?

01:19:05.805 --> 01:19:07.289
You played well yesterday.

01:19:09.552 --> 01:19:10.762
Boys!

01:19:12.096 --> 01:19:13.245
I'm Ramappa Gouda.

01:19:13.325 --> 01:19:16.109
Coach and selection committee member

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:17.923
from Karnataka Cricket Board.

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.672
Hyderabad Team, please fall in line.

01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:24.935
Rajesh, right hand batsman.
- Hi.

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:26.209
Ravi, right arm off spin, sir.
- Hello.

01:19:26.289 --> 01:19:27.487
Srikanth, opening batsman.
- All the best.

01:19:27.567 --> 01:19:28.606
Madhav, right hand batsman, sir.

01:19:28.686 --> 01:19:30.117
Ajith, bowler, sir.
- Very good.

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:33.730
Hey! You are the assistant
coach Murthy, right?

01:19:35.053 --> 01:19:37.654
I thought Murthy is an older man.

01:19:38.484 --> 01:19:40.316
You actually look very young.

01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:44.018
Arjun, right hand batsman.

01:19:44.245 --> 01:19:47.250
Oh. Okay.

01:19:48.136 --> 01:19:50.355
Boys, on to the nets.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:05.772 --> 01:20:06.879
Next!

01:20:10.422 --> 01:20:11.717
Come on, bowl.

01:20:13.466 --> 01:20:15.038
That's a good ball.

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.250
Next!

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.053
Good, next!

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:31.842
Next time play forward. Okay?

01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:34.908
Hey, not you. Next.

01:20:44.994 --> 01:20:48.259
Good. That's it for the day, boys.
See you tomorrow.

01:21:01.016 --> 01:21:02.105
Hi!
- Shall we go?

01:21:02.185 --> 01:21:03.278
Okay.

01:21:41.079 --> 01:21:43.251
Everyone is busy, sir.
They asked you to come later.

01:21:46.241 --> 01:21:47.528
Take it.

01:21:47.608 --> 01:21:49.423
Why do you want to play
when you can teach others?

01:21:49.616 --> 01:21:51.138
At least he's doing something.
What about you?

01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:53.103
Shut up! Don't give him mad ideas.
- Yeah right.

01:22:16.446 --> 01:22:18.189
I told you everyone is busy, sir.

01:22:18.269 --> 01:22:19.684
Why do you want to come every day?

01:22:34.889 --> 01:22:36.819
Money.
- You asked me the other day.

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:39.579
I don't want it.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.649
Hi, Arjun. What a surprise!

01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:47.980
You came at the right time. Come in.

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.087
It's okay, sir. I'll wait here.

01:22:49.167 --> 01:22:51.618
Don't worry, Arjun.
Murthy explained everything.

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.141
Come in, let's talk.

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:55.590
We appointed two
new coaches this time.

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:58.125
You go through this list
once and give me suggestions.

01:22:58.205 --> 01:22:59.716
This guy's batting
track record is good.

01:22:59.796 --> 01:23:01.581
Hyderabad hasn't won
the Ranchi cup since 10 years.

01:23:01.661 --> 01:23:03.494
This time we are
very serious about it.

01:23:04.458 --> 01:23:06.865
The one sitting in
the corner seat is Atul.

01:23:06.945 --> 01:23:08.153
Bombay Team Coach.

01:23:08.293 --> 01:23:10.498
And he's the reason
Bombay Team has been

01:23:10.578 --> 01:23:12.630
winning the Ranchi
cup for the past 3 years.

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:16.127
The one standing is Gouda.
Karnataka Team Coach.

01:23:16.207 --> 01:23:17.548
I met him in the
ground the other day.

01:23:17.628 --> 01:23:23.011
Oh. You already know him.
Let me do this formally.

01:23:23.433 --> 01:23:25.396
Gentlemen!
- 74.

01:23:25.476 --> 01:23:27.060
Do you remember Arjun?

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:29.418
Ex Ranchi player. Retired.

01:23:29.498 --> 01:23:32.788
He's going to join as the Assistant
Coach in our supporting staff.

01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:36.459
Sir, not as a coach, as a player.

01:23:36.539 --> 01:23:37.856
What?

01:23:39.554 --> 01:23:41.113
I want to play again, sir.

01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:47.343
Wait outside.

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:05.677
He's the one who came
in when we were in a meeting.

01:24:05.757 --> 01:24:07.132
Yes, sir. His name is Arjun.

01:24:07.212 --> 01:24:11.362
1979 to 85, he played for Ranchi,
Tulin and South Zone.

01:24:11.442 --> 01:24:13.303
I underestimated him too.

01:24:13.805 --> 01:24:15.803
But look at his records.

01:24:15.883 --> 01:24:17.902
Impeccable records
in first class matches.

01:24:17.982 --> 01:24:20.083
Highest batting
average in the country.

01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:22.689
Amazing talent. Fantastic batsman.

01:24:22.769 --> 01:24:24.017
And wonderful technique.

01:24:24.097 --> 01:24:27.026
If he was really
as talented as you say

01:24:27.435 --> 01:24:30.474
he would be in the team,
not on the screen.

01:24:31.077 --> 01:24:32.566
So, don't waste my time.

01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:37.881
Sir, he might've had
many reasons to quit.

01:24:38.019 --> 01:24:39.763
Please see the recording
of the charity match

01:24:39.924 --> 01:24:42.912
with New Zealand Team.

01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:48.209
Gouda, please stop
this nonsense, really.

01:24:48.595 --> 01:24:50.245
He is bloody 36 years old.

01:24:50.494 --> 01:24:52.110
What will be the use
even if we select him?

01:24:52.714 --> 01:24:57.985
But if we give that
place to a youngster

01:24:58.239 --> 01:25:00.967
it will be a good opportunity
in the national team.

01:25:01.205 --> 01:25:04.455
We need players who have long scope.

01:25:05.965 --> 01:25:07.376
What's so funny?

01:25:08.278 --> 01:25:10.498
Do you know actor Rajesh Khanna?

01:25:10.578 --> 01:25:13.775
I remembered a dialogue
from his movie Anand.

01:25:13.855 --> 01:25:14.864
Tell me.

01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:18.451
Sir, life should be big, not long.

01:25:19.975 --> 01:25:21.768
In fact, if you meet Rajesh Khanna

01:25:21.848 --> 01:25:23.916
you'll argue with him too, right?

01:25:25.657 --> 01:25:27.942
But trust me.
He is really fantastic.

01:25:32.874 --> 01:25:33.959
Arjun!

01:25:35.886 --> 01:25:37.121
Into the nets. Pad up.

01:25:37.379 --> 01:25:38.455
Sir!

01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:42.018
Good ball, man. Good ball.

01:25:42.793 --> 01:25:44.243
Hey.

01:25:51.457 --> 01:25:54.330
This guy is good.
You should watch his...

01:26:00.685 --> 01:26:02.594
Can I borrow your gloves?
- Sorry, man.

01:26:02.674 --> 01:26:04.348
Arjun, we don't have all day.
Come on.

01:26:07.768 --> 01:26:09.107
Where's your glove?
- Swing the ball.

01:26:11.885 --> 01:26:13.014
I can't find it, sir.

01:26:13.094 --> 01:26:14.525
Do you think this is a joke?

01:26:15.606 --> 01:26:16.696
Get out!

01:26:19.769 --> 01:26:20.996
What is this?

01:26:22.686 --> 01:26:23.908
Super, bro!

01:26:25.002 --> 01:26:26.171
That's it.

01:26:26.516 --> 01:26:27.796
One second.

01:26:29.816 --> 01:26:30.940
I can't find it, sir.

01:26:33.376 --> 01:26:35.913
That's it.
You should've seen his face...

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.386
If this had happened a week ago

01:26:43.466 --> 01:26:45.787
I would've laughed along with you.

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:48.927
But now I don't have that much time.

01:26:51.027 --> 01:26:53.764
If you mess with me again...

01:26:55.539 --> 01:26:57.372
If you two misbehave again

01:26:57.517 --> 01:26:59.738
you'll never step
into the stadium again.

01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:01.855
Leave the room.

01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:05.655
Let's go.

01:27:13.598 --> 01:27:17.805
That girl Ramya. She's a journalist.

01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.658
She wrote this article.

01:27:23.866 --> 01:27:25.488
There was a long discussion about it

01:27:25.568 --> 01:27:27.897
in the association
meeting yesterday.

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.506
About this?

01:27:37.095 --> 01:27:39.735
They are very serious
about Ranchi trophy this year.

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:44.450
Atul and Gouda
selected 35 probables.

01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:46.360
After two months of training camp

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.191
they will finalize
15 for the Ranchi team.

01:27:51.211 --> 01:27:53.220
Don't be so happy.

01:27:53.419 --> 01:27:54.756
They can eliminate
you whenever they want

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:56.491
during the two months' training.

01:27:58.003 --> 01:27:59.342
Did they select me?

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.147
Why are you smiling?

01:28:01.227 --> 01:28:03.068
I told you they can eliminate
you whenever they want.

01:28:05.415 --> 01:28:08.570
I told you there's
no need to be so excited.

01:28:16.198 --> 01:28:19.132
Fauja Singh. Running. Age 84.

01:28:19.212 --> 01:28:20.825
Ed Earle. Kayaking.

01:28:22.899 --> 01:28:24.084
Age 40.

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:27.117
Oscar Swahn. Shooting. Age 60.

01:28:27.197 --> 01:28:30.780
There are many successful
people in every sport

01:28:30.923 --> 01:28:33.066
who didn't let their
age be an obstacle.

01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:37.981
Do you know how?
Age is just a number.

01:28:38.982 --> 01:28:40.709
Deep inside they are always young.

01:28:40.789 --> 01:28:43.315
I don't know where
this road will lead to.

01:28:44.339 --> 01:28:48.075
But you are definitely
unfit to start the journey.

01:28:49.698 --> 01:28:52.941
I want the Arjun of 10 years ago.

01:28:56.042 --> 01:28:59.180
If you want to play
for the Indian Team

01:28:59.684 --> 01:29:01.893
you've to play well
for the Ranchi Trophy.

01:29:02.098 --> 01:29:04.727
You should be seen by the selectors.

01:29:06.714 --> 01:29:09.969
I'll do whatever you tell me.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.770
Okay, let's go.

01:29:15.954 --> 01:29:17.670
Have you gone mad?
Why did you write about him?

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:19.369
It's just an article. Leave it.
- I can't.

01:29:19.449 --> 01:29:20.670
You humiliated me.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.346
Go apologize to him.

01:29:31.067 --> 01:29:32.219
What?

01:29:35.553 --> 01:29:36.566
Thank you.

01:29:49.098 --> 01:29:50.865
What was that?
- I don't know.

01:29:50.945 --> 01:29:52.220
Why didn't you stop him?

01:29:54.608 --> 01:29:56.153
What did you do?

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.421
You said you want the
Arjun of 10 years ago.

01:30:07.112 --> 01:30:09.254
Hey! Is this what I asked you to do?

01:30:09.774 --> 01:30:10.798
Sir!

01:30:18.843 --> 01:30:19.990
Hey!

01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:30.895
Should I serve you dinner?

01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:32.929
I'm not hungry. I'll eat later.

01:31:46.887 --> 01:31:49.594
Dad, should I tell you something.

01:31:49.727 --> 01:31:53.474
I told you that Coach
made Rahul the captain

01:31:53.554 --> 01:31:56.507
because he has an
Indian jersey, right?

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.656
He's not the captain now.
He has been removed.

01:31:59.736 --> 01:32:04.565
I thought he was made
captain because of his jersey.

01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:06.081
But that's not true.

01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:11.694
I asked you for a jersey,
but I don't want it now.

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:15.192
It doesn't help to become a captain.

01:32:15.272 --> 01:32:16.853
Vishal.

01:32:16.933 --> 01:32:20.230
You said Vishal had a jersey,
not Rahul.

01:32:21.893 --> 01:32:23.603
Sorry, dad.

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:39.420
You didn't cause the
fight between mom and me.

01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:51.468
So, boys. We finish the
two months' training with today.

01:32:51.677 --> 01:32:54.438
It's time to announce the top 15.

01:32:54.518 --> 01:32:58.562
But you've to wait one
more day to know the results.

01:32:58.642 --> 01:33:01.191
Before the results,
I want to congratulate all you boys

01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:02.796
for the fantastic job.

01:33:03.016 --> 01:33:04.075
All the best!

01:33:04.155 --> 01:33:05.777
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

01:33:08.745 --> 01:33:11.755
They'll announce the
results this evening.

01:33:12.474 --> 01:33:13.809
Are you worried?

01:33:13.889 --> 01:33:18.175
Are you?
- Just a little. Not very.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.727
Don't worry even if I don't
get selected. We'll try again.

01:33:26.719 --> 01:33:29.217
Are you telling
me to believe in you?

01:33:30.297 --> 01:33:31.790
Even if I had a son,
I wouldn't have believed in him

01:33:32.475 --> 01:33:34.419
more than I believe in you.

01:33:47.571 --> 01:33:50.504
I'm not able to handle
stress like before.

01:33:51.257 --> 01:33:52.519
I can't come today evening.

01:33:52.599 --> 01:33:55.902
Come home after getting the results.

01:33:57.381 --> 01:34:00.774
I'll bring rum. We'll enjoy it.

01:34:11.697 --> 01:34:13.020
Remember one thing.

01:34:13.368 --> 01:34:15.028
No matter what happens this evening

01:34:15.405 --> 01:34:17.276
I'm always proud of you.

01:34:17.769 --> 01:34:20.631
You are the best cricketer
I've seen in my career.

01:34:20.941 --> 01:34:24.285
That includes present
Indian cricket team.

01:34:29.631 --> 01:34:32.836
I'm telling you. My name
will be in the list. I know it.

01:34:33.218 --> 01:34:37.154
He's so over confident.
Let's see the results.

01:34:37.292 --> 01:34:38.659
Let me see it.

01:34:47.783 --> 01:34:48.838
Calm down.

01:34:53.169 --> 01:34:55.561
Let me see...

01:35:08.241 --> 01:35:10.956
Okay, see you later. Bye.

01:35:25.188 --> 01:35:26.389
Good job, Arjun.

01:37:04.639 --> 01:37:08.196
Ravinder, I wish you and
your team all the very, very best.

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.476
Play well.
- Thank you so much, sir.

01:37:11.789 --> 01:37:13.259
Congratulations.

01:37:59.781 --> 01:38:00.844
Okay.

01:38:00.924 --> 01:38:02.894
Sridhar, get in.
- Bye, dad.

01:38:03.076 --> 01:38:04.400
Nandu, come on.
- See you, mom.

01:38:05.997 --> 01:38:07.264
Come on, get inside.

01:38:10.064 --> 01:38:11.587
Nani!

01:38:14.539 --> 01:38:16.505
Bye, dad.
- Bye.

01:38:16.829 --> 01:38:17.931
Take care.

01:38:18.566 --> 01:38:19.574
Okay, bye.

01:38:19.654 --> 01:38:21.317
Bye, dad. Bye-bye.

01:38:21.397 --> 01:38:22.681
Bye. Take care.
- Bye, dad.

01:38:25.574 --> 01:38:29.554
Happy journey, dad. Bye.

01:38:43.165 --> 01:38:45.293
TAMIL NADU V/S HYDERABAD
YMCA CRICKET GROUND - CHENNAI

01:38:45.652 --> 01:38:48.204
Hyderabad shouldn't
have chosen to bat first.

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.396
Yes, the ball has
been swinging a lot here.

01:38:50.476 --> 01:38:52.040
They are 78 for 3.

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.397
It is just start of the day.

01:38:53.477 --> 01:38:56.303
They've already lost Nandan Reddy,
Raghu and Vijay.

01:38:57.392 --> 01:38:59.721
Balaji is bowling
a brilliant spell here.

01:38:59.853 --> 01:39:01.602
Just missed. That was close.

01:39:01.682 --> 01:39:03.846
Good job.
- He's really making the ball taught

01:39:03.926 --> 01:39:06.190
and the Hyderabad captain
Ravinder is struggling.

01:39:08.473 --> 01:39:11.224
That is caught behind.
Appeal and the finger goes up.

01:39:11.304 --> 01:39:13.453
He take another wicket and...

01:39:13.858 --> 01:39:17.206
Captain of Hyderabad.
He's walking back to the pavilion.

01:39:19.654 --> 01:39:22.550
Arjun, pad up.
You are going in next.

01:39:22.731 --> 01:39:24.077
Okay, sir.

01:39:28.899 --> 01:39:31.334
Arjun, just stay at the crease.

01:39:31.857 --> 01:39:33.827
It's okay if you
don't make a single run

01:39:33.907 --> 01:39:35.807
even after playing the whole day.

01:39:36.681 --> 01:39:38.757
But you've to be there
till the very end of the day.

01:39:38.837 --> 01:39:39.975
Yes, sir.
- All the best!

01:39:40.055 --> 01:39:42.398
Hyderabad cannot afford
to lose anymore wickets.

01:39:42.478 --> 01:39:43.819
Arjun, defend. Don't attack.

01:39:43.899 --> 01:39:45.431
Srikanth is the next batsman.

01:39:45.511 --> 01:39:48.344
Oh, looks like they are
sending a different player.

01:39:48.424 --> 01:39:50.145
Come on.

01:39:50.225 --> 01:39:52.505
Be careful with this bowler. Okay?

01:39:55.423 --> 01:39:57.127
He by far has to
be the oldest player

01:39:57.207 --> 01:39:58.585
in this Ranchi season 1996.

01:39:58.665 --> 01:39:59.666
Let stump, Umpire.

01:39:59.746 --> 01:40:01.087
All of 36 years.

01:40:01.167 --> 01:40:04.233
Let's see if he can bring any
of his experience into this match.

01:40:13.787 --> 01:40:17.343
Well, Arjun seems to be
checking the field placement here.

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:20.078
Ready to face his
first ball of the match.

01:40:22.748 --> 01:40:26.800
Pitched up and it's in the air.
Will this be another wicket?

01:40:26.991 --> 01:40:30.361
No, it beats the fielder
and that's a six.

01:40:30.499 --> 01:40:31.916
Good job!

01:40:32.456 --> 01:40:33.913
Unorthodox indeed!

01:40:33.993 --> 01:40:35.996
I mean who hits a
six on the first ball

01:40:36.076 --> 01:40:37.780
on day one of a 4 day Ranchi match?

01:40:37.957 --> 01:40:40.295
Well, you know what,
Shashi, Arjun was also

01:40:40.375 --> 01:40:43.700
one of the highest run scorers
in the 86-87 Ranchi season.

01:40:44.458 --> 01:40:47.496
Ball in the air again.
Will this be a boundary? Yes!

01:40:47.576 --> 01:40:49.604
It's out of the
boundary and it's a six!

01:40:49.684 --> 01:40:50.884
Can he get a hatrick?

01:40:51.579 --> 01:40:53.275
We'll have to wait and see.

01:40:53.408 --> 01:40:56.251
Well, Balaji is certainly
not pleased with that one.

01:40:56.331 --> 01:40:57.960
He wouldn't have seen that coming.

01:40:58.138 --> 01:41:00.693
Arjun is scanning
the ground for any gap.

01:41:14.351 --> 01:41:15.825
Yes, he goes for it again

01:41:15.905 --> 01:41:17.005
hitting straight over the bowler

01:41:17.085 --> 01:41:19.770
and this one goes farther
than the previous two shots.

01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:21.682
What an amazing innings
he has been playing.

01:41:21.762 --> 01:41:23.090
Unbelievable!

01:41:23.613 --> 01:41:25.012
Good shot!
- Brilliant!

01:41:25.157 --> 01:41:26.835
Second boundary of the over.

01:41:28.598 --> 01:41:30.892
More runs. This is turning
out to be a good partnership

01:41:30.972 --> 01:41:32.858
between Arjun and James Noyal.

01:41:32.938 --> 01:41:35.120
And that shot brings his 50.

01:41:36.046 --> 01:41:37.051
Wonderful!

01:41:37.131 --> 01:41:38.703
Hit again for a four.

01:41:38.783 --> 01:41:40.301
That's another boundary.

01:41:41.355 --> 01:41:43.838
Just 4 runs away from a century.
That's a single.

01:41:43.918 --> 01:41:46.061
What an innings he's been playing!

01:41:46.185 --> 01:41:49.307
And now just 3 runs
away from hitting a century.

01:41:50.568 --> 01:41:54.217
Oh, he hit it again, the
fielder couldn't stop the ball and

01:41:54.297 --> 01:41:56.408
the ball hits the boundary

01:41:56.488 --> 01:41:58.750
and that brings a century for Arjun.

01:42:01.681 --> 01:42:03.630
Keep going. Keep going, Arjun.

01:42:05.365 --> 01:42:07.349
Hyderabad batsman
Arjun's batting has been

01:42:07.429 --> 01:42:10.345
very entertaining even
for Tamil Nadu supporters.

01:42:10.548 --> 01:42:14.218
What an innings it has been!
Absolutely unbelievable!

01:42:15.152 --> 01:42:17.149
Good job, Arjun! Good job!

01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:18.898
Arjun!
- Well played, Arjun!

01:42:19.489 --> 01:42:20.604
Good job, Arjun! Superb!

01:42:20.684 --> 01:42:21.919
Good job, James!
- Very good!

01:42:22.362 --> 01:42:23.991
Well played.
- Congratulations!

01:42:25.605 --> 01:42:26.787
Well played, Arjun.
- Good game, James.

01:42:26.867 --> 01:42:28.284
Did you see his range of shots?

01:42:29.594 --> 01:42:31.428
Are you thinking
that you played well?

01:42:31.822 --> 01:42:35.254
You put the whole team at
risk with your batting adventure.

01:42:35.697 --> 01:42:37.074
What did I tell you?

01:42:38.725 --> 01:42:40.399
You said the wicket shouldn't
fall till the end of the day.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.160
Well played.

01:43:06.725 --> 01:43:08.726
Good shot, Arjun!

01:43:15.187 --> 01:43:18.707
Mom! Mom! Mom! Dad's photo.
- You are getting late for school.

01:43:18.787 --> 01:43:20.412
Read me what it says.

01:43:21.968 --> 01:43:24.918
In an unexpected
result Hyderabad batsman

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:26.978
Arjun made Hyderabad win.

01:43:27.641 --> 01:43:28.653
Thank you.

Arjun scored 154 runs...
- Your dad!

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.102
We are in the lead now.

01:44:05.182 --> 01:44:07.082
Yes!

tournament starts now.

01:44:08.847 --> 01:44:10.583

How can I help you?

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:33.024
Hello?

01:44:35.017 --> 01:44:36.163
Hello?

01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:42.592
A player in your mind?
- Yeah,

01:44:42.672 --> 01:44:43.962
I've a player in my mind.

01:44:44.074 --> 01:44:46.550
His name is Yuvraj.
And he's from Punjab.

01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:48.453
He made 3 centuries
against Tamil Nadu Team.

01:44:48.533 --> 01:44:51.702
Oh. 3 centuries? That's good.
- He took 20 wickets also.

01:44:53.874 --> 01:44:55.323
Hello, sir!
- Any updates?

01:44:55.498 --> 01:44:56.861
Mumbai on top, as usual.
EDEN GARDENS KOLKATA

01:44:57.243 --> 01:44:59.751
Also sir,
there's a player from Hyderabad

01:45:00.237 --> 01:45:01.448
you should make note of.

01:45:01.622 --> 01:45:03.003
Who?
- Arjun.

01:45:03.375 --> 01:45:05.540
Right hand batsman
from Team Hyderabad.

01:45:05.767 --> 01:45:07.329
Hey, catch the ball.

01:45:07.409 --> 01:45:11.472
Nani! Your dad was
in the papers again today.

01:45:11.743 --> 01:45:13.503
Okay, you go do fielding.

01:45:34.488 --> 01:45:35.971
Dad!

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:54.959
Ramya, please understand.
I can't do this.

01:45:55.039 --> 01:45:57.139
Nandu, just one hour.
- Why don't you understand?

01:45:57.219 --> 01:45:59.237
Even one hour is not possible. Okay?

01:46:00.908 --> 01:46:03.598
It's really not your fault.
It is Nandu's fault.

01:46:06.356 --> 01:46:09.580
But still,
stay close and fight with him.

01:46:10.162 --> 01:46:11.324
Don't go away.

01:46:11.533 --> 01:46:13.110
It's very difficult
to deal with such situations

01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:14.895
if we don't have the support
of our dear ones, Ramya.

01:46:15.373 --> 01:46:16.773
No matter how much
Sarah and I fought

01:46:16.853 --> 01:46:18.284
she always supported me.

01:46:19.286 --> 01:46:21.145
She took it upon herself
to care for the family.

01:46:23.302 --> 01:46:25.180
If she hadn't believed in me

01:46:26.021 --> 01:46:27.540
I wouldn't be playing
like this today.

01:46:29.749 --> 01:46:32.686
Trust me.
He needs you more than ever.

01:46:32.766 --> 01:46:35.492
SAHARA STADIUM - LUCKNOW

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.574
I really like your game, Arjun.

01:46:41.837 --> 01:46:44.217
Your every shot is so perfect.

01:46:44.297 --> 01:46:47.822
Like... Straight from the text book.

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:51.536
If I practice,
maybe I can play like you.

01:46:52.128 --> 01:46:53.519
But...

01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:59.198
The way you spoke to Ramya
that day that I can't do.

01:47:00.058 --> 01:47:01.290
Thanks.

01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:06.022
Arjun, I'm sorry for what I did.

01:47:07.198 --> 01:47:08.699
Let's play for the team.

01:47:11.257 --> 01:47:13.308
UTTAR PRADESH V/S HYDERABAD

01:47:28.606 --> 01:47:30.710
Your client Arjun's
photo is in the papers, sir.

01:47:33.386 --> 01:47:34.609
Arjun!

01:47:36.352 --> 01:47:38.356
Work on your fitness first.

01:47:38.633 --> 01:47:41.301
You'll always hit fours and sixes?
No singles?

01:47:41.381 --> 01:47:42.961
Every single is important.

01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:45.423
Now run 5 runs of this ground.
Run. Come on, go.

01:47:47.423 --> 01:47:49.766
HYDERABAD V/S MAHARASHTRA
L.B. STADIUM - HYDERABAD

01:48:10.203 --> 01:48:12.024
Hyderabad is going to semi finals.

01:48:12.104 --> 01:48:14.560
Yes! We'll win the cup this time!

01:48:17.795 --> 01:48:20.226
Boys! Boys!
Boys! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

01:48:20.549 --> 01:48:22.414
It's too early for celebration.

01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:24.184
'He doesn't let us have
fun even for 5 minutes.'

01:48:52.286 --> 01:48:55.558
I'll get changed. We'll go out.

01:48:55.859 --> 01:48:57.099
Okay.

01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:31.437
What will you have, sir?

01:49:33.426 --> 01:49:34.453
Two teas.

01:49:39.546 --> 01:49:40.919
Do you remember this place?

01:49:43.405 --> 01:49:44.906
I remember the table too.

01:49:47.186 --> 01:49:48.213
Listen...

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.463
I'm very sorry.

01:49:51.570 --> 01:49:54.710
I did a mistake.
I said many hurtful things to you.

01:49:55.596 --> 01:49:56.818
I'm very sorry.

01:50:02.403 --> 01:50:03.480
It's okay.

01:50:07.621 --> 01:50:10.260
We won't have any
problems in our life now.

01:50:11.053 --> 01:50:12.461
Everything will be normal.

01:50:12.876 --> 01:50:14.868
Not just normal, we'll be happy.

01:50:19.882 --> 01:50:24.265
Dad came home.
He said he'll give us 50,000.

01:50:24.572 --> 01:50:28.483
You go and pay the
lawyer immediately.

01:50:29.103 --> 01:50:30.719
I'll resign right away.

01:50:33.003 --> 01:50:35.190
I can't work there anymore.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.650
Happily, let's just
go back to our normal life.

01:50:40.759 --> 01:50:44.128
It's been so long since
we all had a good laugh at home.

01:50:53.703 --> 01:50:55.279
Did you take money from your dad?

01:50:56.577 --> 01:51:01.372
Please don't be angry with me.
I didn't take it.

01:51:01.704 --> 01:51:04.374
Dad just said he'll give it to us.

01:51:04.955 --> 01:51:07.957
We don't have to take it
if you don't want to. Just leave it.

01:51:08.037 --> 01:51:09.260
It's okay.

01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:14.077
No. It's not about money.

01:51:16.747 --> 01:51:18.026
You don't believe in me, do you?

01:51:18.779 --> 01:51:21.940
Don't you dare say that, Arjun!
Don't you dare say that!

01:51:22.438 --> 01:51:25.334
I left my family and
came to live with you.

01:51:25.863 --> 01:51:27.231
Don't you dare say that!

01:51:27.851 --> 01:51:29.356
I don't want any of these things.

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.853
I just need a simple life.

01:51:32.074 --> 01:51:33.978
You, me and Nani, that's it.

01:51:34.279 --> 01:51:36.670
I just want you back, that's it.

01:51:37.175 --> 01:51:38.924
I don't care about what's
going on in your game.

01:51:39.004 --> 01:51:41.378
You can't do anything
now no matter how hard you try.

01:51:41.458 --> 01:51:43.379
You had your chance
and it's over now.

01:51:46.639 --> 01:51:48.171
I heard this many times, Sarah.

01:51:48.587 --> 01:51:50.097
You can't do anything.
You can't do anything.

01:51:51.107 --> 01:51:52.644
I felt very sad
every time I heard it.

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:57.187
But hearing it from
you is making me scared.

01:51:57.893 --> 01:51:59.574
I'm scared that maybe
I won't be able to do anything.

01:52:03.984 --> 01:52:07.374
I'm angry with you for
the first time in my life.

01:52:17.073 --> 01:52:20.681
DELHI V/S MAHARASHTRA
GYMKHANA GROUND - HYDERABAD

01:52:21.834 --> 01:52:23.121
That's hit hard.

01:52:23.201 --> 01:52:25.389
The ball is going, going and gone.

01:52:25.576 --> 01:52:28.499
The ball has gone
out of the ground and...

01:52:29.136 --> 01:52:30.968
Another six by Arjun!

01:52:31.048 --> 01:52:33.502
What an innings this
is turning out to be!

01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:43.256
The ball is going
to the boundary again.

01:52:43.336 --> 01:52:45.438
A fielder is...
Oh, the fielder stopped it.

01:52:45.518 --> 01:52:48.366
Hyderabad, very close
to winning the semi finals.

01:52:48.446 --> 01:52:50.891
Another century for
Arjun in the tournament.

01:52:50.971 --> 01:52:52.994
Hey! Congrats, man!

01:52:54.194 --> 01:52:55.828
Arjun?
- Did he injure himself?

01:52:56.733 --> 01:52:58.614
I think they should
call for the physio.

01:52:58.751 --> 01:53:00.606
Physio!
- Yeah, they are. Is he alright?

01:53:00.686 --> 01:53:03.152
Oh no, he doesn't
look very alright to me.

01:53:03.365 --> 01:53:04.920
Must be dehydration.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.790
These weather conditions
can get really tough on you.

01:53:09.374 --> 01:53:11.418
He refuses to get aid.

01:53:11.778 --> 01:53:14.300
Well, he seems to be doing okay now.

01:53:16.121 --> 01:53:18.409
And he lifts his
bat for his century.

01:53:19.086 --> 01:53:21.948
Well, what a man! What an innings!

01:53:26.058 --> 01:53:27.202
Well played, Arjun!

01:53:30.496 --> 01:53:32.458
Hey, champion!

01:53:32.538 --> 01:53:34.027
Well played.

01:53:36.450 --> 01:53:39.104
I don't feel good, sir.
Shall we go to the hospital?

01:53:47.532 --> 01:53:49.650
I don't think there's
anything to be worried about.

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.200
It may be because
of too much strain.

01:53:52.459 --> 01:53:55.282
It will be good to
get a TMT and 2D Echo.

01:53:56.582 --> 01:53:58.842
Doctor, we've the Ranji
finals match in Mumbai next week.

01:53:59.108 --> 01:54:00.115
Is it okay for him to play?

01:54:00.195 --> 01:54:02.055
First get these tests done.

01:54:02.474 --> 01:54:04.152
How can you say that, sir?

01:54:05.418 --> 01:54:07.232
There's no need to worry, dear.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.673
That's what the doctor said.

01:54:08.927 --> 01:54:11.070
The selectors are coming
to the match next week.

01:54:12.757 --> 01:54:15.316
This match is very
important to Arjun.

01:54:15.484 --> 01:54:18.681
Otherwise all his efforts
till date will go waste.

01:54:19.107 --> 01:54:21.693
He's lying on the bed without
knowing what his condition is.

01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:24.164
How can you talk
about next week's match?

01:54:24.244 --> 01:54:25.248
Sarah, please.

01:54:25.328 --> 01:54:26.723
Please let me talk.

01:54:29.003 --> 01:54:30.530
The doctor prescribed
some tests, right?

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:32.554
We've to wait till the
month end to get my salary

01:54:32.634 --> 01:54:34.652
to get those tests done.

01:54:36.242 --> 01:54:39.014
What is he doing leaving
me and Nani at home?

01:54:40.254 --> 01:54:44.023
Why are you still giving
him false hope, sir?

01:54:48.396 --> 01:54:51.131
Listen...
I think it's time for you to decide.

01:54:51.496 --> 01:54:54.324
Do you want me and Nani
or do you want cricket?

01:54:56.212 --> 01:54:58.582
If you want cricket,
we won't be in your life anymore.

01:54:59.262 --> 01:55:00.291
You decide.

01:56:06.102 --> 01:56:07.928
Hi, Arjun.
- Hello.

01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:10.694
Nandu.
- Hi.

01:56:10.774 --> 01:56:11.966
Hi.
- Hi.

01:56:15.468 --> 01:56:18.576
Does your family
always smile like this?

01:56:38.154 --> 01:56:41.807
Dad, there are paint
brushes in the cupboard.

01:56:41.887 --> 01:56:44.846
Will you get them for me?
I can't reach them.

01:56:49.058 --> 01:56:50.425
Come on.

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:13.641
I gave Sachin's poster to Raju.

01:57:18.836 --> 01:57:24.406
None of my friends had
their dads' photo in the papers.

01:57:24.915 --> 01:57:30.876
I have this photo.
So I gave Sachin's poster to Raju.

01:57:33.301 --> 01:57:36.003
Dad, won't you play cricket again?

01:57:42.673 --> 01:57:45.197
You tell me. Should I play or not?

01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:51.476
Play, dad. You play very well.
You look like a hero.

01:58:06.527 --> 01:58:08.831
Sarah madam! Sarah madam!

01:58:09.590 --> 01:58:10.857
Sarah!

01:58:11.106 --> 01:58:12.272
Sarah!

01:58:31.781 --> 01:58:33.118
Nani went outside to play.

01:58:45.667 --> 01:58:48.899
I can't live like this, Sarah.
I just can't.

01:58:51.418 --> 01:58:53.604
I'm not doing it to spite you.

01:58:54.650 --> 01:58:56.039
Do you know something?

01:58:56.610 --> 01:58:58.579
If anyone lends me money
they don't ask it back.

01:58:59.006 --> 01:59:00.249
Do you know why?

01:59:01.394 --> 01:59:02.634
Not because they like me.

01:59:06.136 --> 01:59:08.328
Because they are convinced
that I can't pay them back.

01:59:10.829 --> 01:59:12.390
The people I know and
the people who know me

01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:13.968
gave up hopes on me long back.

01:59:16.498 --> 01:59:18.098
Once upon a time I
was a good cricket player.

01:59:19.658 --> 01:59:20.887
Now I'm a loser.

01:59:22.392 --> 01:59:24.208
It's not their fault
that they think that.

01:59:27.389 --> 01:59:28.886
Because I was like that.

01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:35.048
In this big world, the only
one who didn't judge me till date

01:59:38.548 --> 01:59:39.816
is my son.

01:59:41.723 --> 01:59:44.081
He doesn't care whether
his dad is working or not

01:59:44.161 --> 01:59:46.433
earning or not,
whether he's successful or not.

01:59:48.449 --> 01:59:50.696
I'm his dad. That's it.

01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:55.513
He never asked me anything
till today, Sarah.

01:59:58.671 --> 01:59:59.831
I don't know why

02:00:01.035 --> 02:00:02.912
he asked me to buy him a jersey.

02:00:05.829 --> 02:00:07.083
But I couldn't buy him that.

02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:10.013
Do you know what my fear is?

02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:15.936
If I stay like this, maybe
he'll view me like others one day.

02:00:23.088 --> 02:00:28.893
He told me earlier
that I look a hero to him

02:00:29.391 --> 02:00:31.417
when I play cricket.

02:00:34.596 --> 02:00:37.453
I can't bear it if he
thinks any less of me, Sarah.

02:00:48.679 --> 02:00:49.910
Let me go, Sarah.

02:00:51.341 --> 02:00:52.350
Please.

02:00:57.199 --> 02:00:58.988
I'm not angry with you.

02:01:00.497 --> 02:01:01.574
Should I tell you
whom I'm angry with?

02:01:03.295 --> 02:01:05.022
The Arjun who sits
on the sofa every day and

02:01:05.256 --> 02:01:08.599
watches cricket
without doing any work.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:19.452
The Arjun who couldn't
fulfill Nani's small wish.

02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:27.290
The Arjun who makes
you cry in the kitchen.

02:01:33.713 --> 02:01:35.068
I'm not angry with you, Sarah.

02:01:38.487 --> 02:01:40.034
Not at all.

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:13.128
You'll be tired tomorrow if
you travel all night in the train.

02:02:15.982 --> 02:02:18.101
Morning 5 am flight.

02:02:19.303 --> 02:02:21.751
I booked a hotel
with the travel desk.

02:02:25.384 --> 02:02:29.933
Please stay the night with
me without thinking anything.

02:02:38.847 --> 02:02:42.655
Who is more important to you?
Me or Nani?

02:02:47.027 --> 02:02:48.156
You.

02:02:49.131 --> 02:02:50.332
Don't lie to me.

02:03:31.489 --> 02:03:32.841
RANJI FINAL - 1996-97

02:03:32.921 --> 02:03:35.328
MUMBAI V/S HYDERABAD
WANKHEDE STADIUM - MUMBAI

02:03:35.696 --> 02:03:38.082
Welcome to the Wankhede
Stadium, Mumbai.

02:03:38.162 --> 02:03:40.069
This is day one of
the Ranji finals between

02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:41.657
Mumbai and Hyderabad.

02:03:41.976 --> 02:03:44.749
This is the match both the teams
have been waiting for. - My dad!

02:03:44.829 --> 02:03:46.366
And this is the decider...
- Look, our Arjun!

02:03:46.446 --> 02:03:48.630
It's a full house and
first ever day and night

02:03:48.710 --> 02:03:51.032
Ranji match in the history
of Ranji Tournament.

02:03:51.112 --> 02:03:54.110
Home ground for Mumbai
and Mumbai won the toss

02:03:54.190 --> 02:03:55.212
and elected to bat.

02:03:55.292 --> 02:03:57.105
This is a crucial toss to win, and

02:03:57.185 --> 02:03:59.523
the wicket will get tougher
as the match progresses.

02:03:59.603 --> 02:04:01.870
First ball,
and Mumbai gets off the mark.

02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:05.562
That is driven. The ball
races to the boundary. It's a four.

02:04:18.391 --> 02:04:20.594
Straight down the ground.
Another four.

02:04:20.674 --> 02:04:22.709
Hyderabad cannot believe it.

02:04:24.325 --> 02:04:26.677
Easy runs, goes into the crowd.

02:04:30.995 --> 02:04:33.397
Oh, bowled him.
Finally a wicket for Hyderabad.

02:04:33.477 --> 02:04:34.985
Spectacular innings by the batsman.

02:04:35.065 --> 02:04:37.624
It's Day 2 and Mumbai
is boasting a massive score.

02:04:37.704 --> 02:04:39.561
That's another six.
- Wonderful!

02:04:39.641 --> 02:04:42.190
Good shot!
- More runs for Mumbai.

02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:44.028
That's a massive score.

02:04:49.763 --> 02:04:51.783
All the best!
- Let's do it.

02:04:51.916 --> 02:04:53.355
Three slips and a gully.

02:04:53.435 --> 02:04:56.012
Shammi bowling the first ball.
What a bouncer!

02:04:56.092 --> 02:04:57.983
Oh! He didn't know where it went!

02:05:03.536 --> 02:05:04.720
Taken.

02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:08.301
That is bowled.

02:05:16.254 --> 02:05:17.450
Bowled again.

02:05:17.530 --> 02:05:19.166
He just knows what he's doing.

02:05:19.246 --> 02:05:21.297
Shammi gets another wicket.

02:05:21.377 --> 02:05:24.529
Hyderabad Team total 45
for 4 at the end of the Day 2.

02:05:24.730 --> 02:05:28.073
Day 3 of the Ranji finals.
And Hyderabad needs a savior.

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:30.017
Will Arjun come to their rescue?

02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:32.760
No, it's not him.
Shammi knocks over Arjun.

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:34.271
Mumbai is celebrating.

02:05:36.484 --> 02:05:39.474
Walking back to the pavilion
the danger man Arjun departs.

02:05:39.593 --> 02:05:41.694
Another wicket for Hyderabad
and they are falling down

02:05:41.774 --> 02:05:43.397
like a house of cards.

02:05:46.915 --> 02:05:48.827
Bowled him.
- Takes the catch.

02:05:48.907 --> 02:05:50.364
Out.
- The finger goes up.

02:05:50.444 --> 02:05:51.969
That's a catch in the wind.

02:05:54.976 --> 02:05:56.042
Catch it.

02:05:57.968 --> 02:05:59.346
Clicked away for a four.

02:05:59.764 --> 02:06:01.642
Runs are pouring for Mumbai.

02:06:06.677 --> 02:06:08.378
Pulled away for another boundary.

02:06:08.617 --> 02:06:10.665
Mumbai in a comfortable
lead and on the verge of

02:06:10.745 --> 02:06:13.098
winning the match
and the Ranji Tournament.

02:06:18.234 --> 02:06:19.629
What's with your useless fielding?

02:06:19.793 --> 02:06:21.804
That's more than enough
for your useless bowling.

02:06:22.044 --> 02:06:24.414
No matter what we say now or
how hard we play it's all in vain.

02:06:25.054 --> 02:06:27.015
We saw how those guys are playing.

02:06:27.724 --> 02:06:29.247
There's no chance that
we can win the match.

02:06:31.015 --> 02:06:34.378
All our hard work for the
past 6 months is all in vain?

02:06:34.661 --> 02:06:36.613
It's a great achievement
for us to reach here.

02:06:56.332 --> 02:06:59.390
47 overs and 352 is the target, sir.

02:06:59.577 --> 02:07:01.473
Required run rate is 7.47.

02:07:01.722 --> 02:07:04.635
Even if the match is a draw,
as per the innings rule

02:07:04.835 --> 02:07:07.395
Mumbai's first innings
score is more, so they will win.

02:07:07.638 --> 02:07:11.015
If we want to win the match,
we've to chase this target.

02:07:11.095 --> 02:07:13.118
Last day the pitch was
very unpredictable, sir.

02:07:13.198 --> 02:07:16.281
352 in 47 overs is very hard.

02:07:26.751 --> 02:07:28.226
Change in plans for Hyderabad.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.840
Arjun who bats for
Hyderabad on fourth round

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.678
is now opening
alongside Nandan Reddy

02:07:32.758 --> 02:07:34.085
in the second innings.

02:07:34.305 --> 02:07:36.506
Mumbai has a lead of 351 runs and

02:07:36.586 --> 02:07:38.064
boy, they must be happy.

02:07:38.187 --> 02:07:40.596
So close to winning the
Ranji Tournament here in Mumbai.

02:07:40.676 --> 02:07:42.593
They must be celebrating.

02:07:42.673 --> 02:07:43.868
Wonderful really, Mumbai.

02:07:43.948 --> 02:07:45.316
You know, they started celebrating.

02:07:45.396 --> 02:07:46.990
Hyderabad has to
do something magical

02:07:47.070 --> 02:07:48.539
if they want to win this match.

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:52.281
And 351 runs in just
47 overs on a Day 4 pitch

02:07:52.361 --> 02:07:54.194
seems just beyond possible.

02:07:54.654 --> 02:07:56.619
Arjun at the batting
end and Shammi all ready

02:07:56.699 --> 02:07:59.173
to bowl the first ball
of the second innings.

02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:05.358
Oh, that's a deadly bouncer.

02:08:06.035 --> 02:08:07.682
Shammi attacking with the ball.

02:08:07.863 --> 02:08:09.382
Shammi trying to play it dirty.

02:08:09.462 --> 02:08:11.126
Trying to distract the batsman.

02:08:11.206 --> 02:08:13.872
Does the batsman have
a reply to that one?

02:08:19.558 --> 02:08:21.197
Oh, pulled perfectly.

02:08:21.277 --> 02:08:23.132
What a terrific shot!

02:08:25.116 --> 02:08:27.702
That's a 50 partnership
for Arjun and Nandan Reddy.

02:08:30.105 --> 02:08:31.456
Oh, great shot!

02:08:31.699 --> 02:08:33.306
They need those singles.

02:08:33.386 --> 02:08:34.891
Good running between the wickets.

02:08:34.971 --> 02:08:37.601
And good understanding
between the batsmen as well.

02:08:39.328 --> 02:08:40.626
That is played to the off side.

02:08:40.706 --> 02:08:42.276
A call for the second.

02:08:43.292 --> 02:08:44.854
More running between the wickets.

02:08:44.934 --> 02:08:47.054
And Arjun gets to his half century.

02:08:47.134 --> 02:08:49.706
This man is making
his intentions quite clear.

02:08:49.786 --> 02:08:50.798
What a crucial innings!

02:08:50.878 --> 02:08:54.536
Doesn't dad lift his
bat when he completes 50 runs?

02:08:54.616 --> 02:08:55.865
No, he lifts it only
when he makes a century.

02:08:55.945 --> 02:08:57.415
Will Hyderabad have a chance here?

02:08:57.552 --> 02:08:59.851
230 runs required out of 210 balls.

02:09:00.386 --> 02:09:01.856
Oh, front foot, and misses the ball.

02:09:01.936 --> 02:09:03.266
The keeper doesn't
miss the opportunity.

02:09:03.346 --> 02:09:06.262
The finger goes up
and Nandan Reddy departs.

02:09:07.225 --> 02:09:10.084
Hyderabad looking to keep
up with the required run rate.

02:09:10.164 --> 02:09:11.618
Another four.

02:09:16.664 --> 02:09:18.138
The ball goes high in the air.

02:09:18.218 --> 02:09:20.226
A fielder coming in, and it's taken.

02:09:20.306 --> 02:09:21.743
James throws his wicket away.

02:09:22.115 --> 02:09:24.426
Oh, Ravinder completely
misses that one.

02:09:34.212 --> 02:09:35.585
That is hit hard.

02:09:35.665 --> 02:09:38.043
The ball is traveling
over the boundary.

02:09:38.123 --> 02:09:40.735
This man Arjun hits
all around the park.

02:09:42.802 --> 02:09:45.459
Come on, man.
Come on, we need a wicket.

02:09:59.079 --> 02:10:00.938
Arvind Chopra is ready to bowl.

02:10:01.018 --> 02:10:02.803
How will Arjun get to his century?

02:10:05.368 --> 02:10:08.335
That is an unbelievable hit.
Will this go all the way?

02:10:08.415 --> 02:10:09.609
There's a fielder coming under it.

02:10:09.689 --> 02:10:12.029
He doesn't reach it. That's a six.

02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:14.403
Arjun hits yet another a century!

02:10:14.483 --> 02:10:16.424
Yes!
- What an innings!

02:10:16.781 --> 02:10:19.565
I think Hyderabad needed that boost.

02:10:19.792 --> 02:10:21.103
Well played, Arjun!

02:10:21.183 --> 02:10:23.063
Clearly my man of the tournament.

02:10:28.653 --> 02:10:31.344
The question is,
does Hyderabad have a chance here?

02:10:32.882 --> 02:10:35.013
Hyderabad is doing
the right thing here.

02:10:35.093 --> 02:10:36.868
Taking runs between the wickets

02:10:36.948 --> 02:10:39.319
not leaving any
opportunity to do so.

02:10:48.791 --> 02:10:50.402
More running between the wickets.

02:10:50.482 --> 02:10:52.267
The ball races to the boundary.

02:10:53.468 --> 02:10:54.808
Well driven.

02:10:57.719 --> 02:10:58.732
Shot!

02:10:58.812 --> 02:11:00.492
Hit straight for a six.

02:11:00.898 --> 02:11:02.863
Just a little touch of the bat.

02:11:03.047 --> 02:11:04.323
Shammi blocking the way

02:11:04.403 --> 02:11:06.932
but Arjun manages to
reach the crease in time.

02:11:07.012 --> 02:11:08.840
That is the most I've seen him run.

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.770
He usually deals in boundaries.

02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:12.361
Today is another story.

02:11:21.249 --> 02:11:24.235
He knows the importance
of singles at this moment.

02:11:24.315 --> 02:11:28.945
Every run counts and every
run takes him closer to the target.

02:11:39.395 --> 02:11:42.455
That's lifted in the air
and an easy catch for Shammi.

02:11:42.535 --> 02:11:43.915
That's bowled.

02:11:43.995 --> 02:11:45.278
Another wicket.

02:11:46.186 --> 02:11:48.697
That is quick. Mumbai
appeals and the finger goes up.

02:11:48.777 --> 02:11:50.441
Hyderabad loses its sixth wicket.

02:11:50.521 --> 02:11:53.988
It's 285 for 6.
67 required of 36 balls.

02:11:54.214 --> 02:11:55.869
New batsman Anil at the crease.

02:11:55.949 --> 02:11:58.481
Will they take another single?
No, they don't.

02:11:58.561 --> 02:12:00.114
Arjun doesn't seem pleased.

02:12:00.571 --> 02:12:02.638
He wants to have a word with Anil.
- Anil! Run rate is increasing.

02:12:02.718 --> 02:12:04.904
Just keep running.
Singles are very important to us.

02:12:06.814 --> 02:12:08.369
That is hit between the fielders.

02:12:08.449 --> 02:12:09.598
Shammi blocking the way.

02:12:09.678 --> 02:12:12.437
Arjun falls,
but manages to reach the crease.

02:12:13.427 --> 02:12:17.288
Oh, this is getting heated.
Nasty tactics by Mumbai.

02:12:17.368 --> 02:12:19.670
An umpire intervenes just in time.

02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:22.283
This is not done.
Shammi shouldn't have done this.

02:12:23.672 --> 02:12:25.715
Bowled him. Another wicket.

02:12:25.795 --> 02:12:27.575
Hyderabad cannot
afford to lose a wicket

02:12:27.655 --> 02:12:29.086
at this stage of the game.

02:12:29.166 --> 02:12:31.808
Anil walking back at 289 for 7.

02:12:32.152 --> 02:12:34.261
The required run rate is rocketing.

02:12:34.604 --> 02:12:36.597
Will that be another wicket?
It's given.

02:12:36.677 --> 02:12:39.000
Shammi causing mayhem.
He is on a hatrick.

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:41.685
Hyderabad losing the plot here.
289 for 8.

02:12:41.765 --> 02:12:43.614
Hyderabad needs some big h hits.

02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:45.723
Shot!
- Second boundary of the over.

02:12:46.177 --> 02:12:48.452
Another one.
Hitting the fielder on the off side.

02:12:48.579 --> 02:12:50.339
Shammi again in
the way and this time

02:12:50.419 --> 02:12:52.376
Arjun gets the better of him.

02:12:53.437 --> 02:12:56.337
More runs here.
The ball goes into the crowd.

02:13:01.695 --> 02:13:04.511
Will that be another wicket?
Yes! Safe hands.

02:13:04.591 --> 02:13:07.077
Hyderabad throwing away
another wicket. 305 for 9.

02:13:07.157 --> 02:13:09.344
They require 12 runs per over.

02:13:09.424 --> 02:13:12.963
Mumbai just one wicket away
from winning the Ranji trophy.

02:13:13.043 --> 02:13:16.235
Wajid Khan.
The last batsman at the crease.

02:13:16.315 --> 02:13:18.820
There must be immense
pressure on the young man.

02:13:19.635 --> 02:13:22.436
That's a good ball.
Taking the batsman by surprise.

02:13:22.602 --> 02:13:24.146
Another dud ball.

02:13:24.226 --> 02:13:26.627
Can he get a single?
Punch to the bowler.

02:13:26.707 --> 02:13:28.071
They run, they don't run.

02:13:28.151 --> 02:13:30.640
Oh, back in the crease just in time.

02:13:30.993 --> 02:13:32.188
Wajid!

02:13:33.179 --> 02:13:35.050
The last over was a maiden over.

02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:36.643
Arjun is at the crease.

02:13:36.723 --> 02:13:38.979
Shammi going to bowl
the last second over.

02:13:40.130 --> 02:13:42.512
That is hit above the square leg.
No man at hand.

02:13:42.592 --> 02:13:43.861
That goes to the boundary.

02:13:43.941 --> 02:13:46.194
Let's see what Arjun
can do in this crucial over.

02:13:46.274 --> 02:13:47.850
Will he turn the game around?

02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:49.431
Come on, boys! Come on!

02:13:49.511 --> 02:13:51.260
That finds the gap between
the point and the gully.

02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:54.768
Another boundary.
24 runs now required of 9 balls.

02:13:55.326 --> 02:13:56.969
Comes down the crease
and hits straight.

02:13:57.049 --> 02:13:59.630
Miraj trying to reach
it but doesn't. That's a six.

02:13:59.993 --> 02:14:02.716
More runs. 18 of the over already.
- Yes!

02:14:03.204 --> 02:14:05.254
Arjun would want
to take a single here.

02:14:05.386 --> 02:14:08.755
Fielders closing in.
Will he get a run?

02:14:09.126 --> 02:14:11.092
No! Exactly what the
Mumbai wants him to do.

02:14:11.172 --> 02:14:13.851
And Hyderabad disappointed.
What will they do now?

02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:18.079
Don't worry. 6 balls, 14 runs.

02:14:18.159 --> 02:14:19.230
It's okay, Wajid.

02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:20.545
Wajid!

02:14:20.935 --> 02:14:22.099
Wajid!

02:14:25.545 --> 02:14:27.259
We are playing the finals, Wajid.

02:14:27.896 --> 02:14:28.985
Go and strike!

02:14:30.198 --> 02:14:32.226
Come on, guys! Come on! Come on!

02:14:35.077 --> 02:14:37.142
14 runs required in the last over.

02:14:37.222 --> 02:14:38.321
Wajid on strike.

02:14:38.401 --> 02:14:41.028
Will he take a single
and get Arjun back on strike?

02:14:42.689 --> 02:14:45.512
Oh, that was close.
He misses the first ball.

02:14:45.592 --> 02:14:49.564
No chance for a run.
It's 14 runs of 5 balls now.

02:14:51.929 --> 02:14:53.195
He misses it again.

02:14:53.275 --> 02:14:55.809
Mumbai successful in
not giving them a single.

02:14:55.889 --> 02:14:57.737
What will Hyderabad do now?

02:14:57.924 --> 02:15:00.195
14 runs required of 4 balls now.

02:15:00.275 --> 02:15:03.372
It's high time they get a
single or they are losing the match.

02:15:03.452 --> 02:15:06.416
Abhay ready to ball.
The tension is building.

02:15:06.496 --> 02:15:08.587
This is the third
ball of the last over.

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:11.379
And Hyderabad needs a single.
Will they get it?

02:15:11.742 --> 02:15:13.952
Oh, he misses it again,
but they are running.

02:15:14.032 --> 02:15:15.701
Will it be an out? Keeper throws it.

02:15:15.781 --> 02:15:18.379
It misses the wicket.
Abhay throws it back. It strikes.

02:15:18.459 --> 02:15:19.610
What's that?
- It's an appeal here.

02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:21.691
Is Hyderabad losing its last wicket?

02:15:23.098 --> 02:15:25.591
Umpire says not out.
- Come on, Arjun!

02:15:25.671 --> 02:15:29.224
Hyderabad now needs
13 runs of the last 3 balls.

02:15:29.304 --> 02:15:31.644
Will this man finish
it off for Hyderabad?

02:15:31.724 --> 02:15:34.647
This needs to be a big shot.
This needs to be a boundary.

02:15:34.727 --> 02:15:36.799
Abhay bowling the
fourth ball of the over.

02:15:36.965 --> 02:15:38.826
Will Arjun do it for Hyderabad?

02:15:39.158 --> 02:15:41.697
Square cut. Beats the cover
and races to the boundary.

02:15:41.777 --> 02:15:43.143
And that's a four.

02:15:43.223 --> 02:15:44.921
Come on, Arjun!
- Hyderabad still has a chance here.

02:15:45.001 --> 02:15:47.135
9 runs required of the last 2 balls.
- Yes!

02:15:47.215 --> 02:15:50.071
Is Hyderabad going to snatch
this match away from Mumbai?

02:15:50.151 --> 02:15:51.386
Mumbai cannot believe it.

02:15:51.466 --> 02:15:53.026
Are they going to
lose this tournament?

02:15:53.106 --> 02:15:55.088
They don't seem very happy.

02:15:56.984 --> 02:15:58.803
Will this man hit another biggie?

02:15:58.883 --> 02:16:00.498
They need a six for sure.

02:16:00.578 --> 02:16:03.421
Fifth ball of the over.
What is going to happen?

02:16:08.866 --> 02:16:11.731
Oh, he hits it hard.
The ball is going.

02:16:11.811 --> 02:16:13.988
Will it land in the crowd?
Yes, it does.

02:16:14.068 --> 02:16:15.889
What a shot! Unbelievable!

02:16:15.969 --> 02:16:17.640
Yeah, sixer!
- 'This man is on fire!'

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.554
'Good for Hyderabad.
What an innings!'

02:16:20.715 --> 02:16:22.446
'Abhay completely
clueless about Arjun.'

02:16:22.526 --> 02:16:23.753
Yes! Yes!

02:16:24.847 --> 02:16:27.778
Hyderabad now requires
only 3 runs of the last ball.

02:16:28.203 --> 02:16:30.895
The team knows that Arjun
can finish it off for them.

02:16:31.241 --> 02:16:33.916
Just one more boundary
is all he needs to hit.

02:16:34.296 --> 02:16:35.668
Will he do it again?

02:16:35.784 --> 02:16:37.165
Mumbai setting the field now.

02:16:37.245 --> 02:16:39.021
They don't want to
give another boundary.

02:17:01.159 --> 02:17:02.430
Yes!

02:17:02.741 --> 02:17:04.761
Come on!

02:17:06.235 --> 02:17:07.904
Come on!

02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:12.372
Come on Arjun!

02:17:18.293 --> 02:17:20.455
Throw the ball! Throw it!

02:17:23.092 --> 02:17:26.430
Come on, Arjun! Run! Run!

02:17:29.293 --> 02:17:31.394
Hurry up, throw the ball!

02:17:31.818 --> 02:17:33.479
Run!

02:17:34.508 --> 02:17:36.994
Come on, come on, come on!

02:17:37.617 --> 02:17:40.039
Run, Arjun! Run!

02:17:40.526 --> 02:17:42.134
Come on, Arjun!

02:17:46.027 --> 02:17:47.804
How's that?

02:17:47.884 --> 02:17:49.509
Will he lift the finger?

02:17:49.725 --> 02:17:51.297
And he said no.

02:17:51.377 --> 02:17:53.489
Yes!
- Hyderabad wins the match.

02:17:53.569 --> 02:17:55.088
Can you believe it?

02:17:55.395 --> 02:17:56.940
What an innings this has been!

02:17:57.020 --> 02:17:59.448
Arjun makes the win single handedly.

02:17:59.808 --> 02:18:04.430
Well, Ranji 96-97
is taken by Hyderabad.

02:18:45.694 --> 02:18:47.934
HYDERABAD 2019

02:19:13.278 --> 02:19:14.674
I'll go and find out.

02:19:21.307 --> 02:19:22.509
Nani!

02:19:39.666 --> 02:19:40.801
I think it's this way.

02:19:51.319 --> 02:19:52.820
One second.

02:19:53.036 --> 02:19:55.402
Sarah! How are you?

02:19:56.006 --> 02:19:57.512
Hi!

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:00.431
Hey! Hey!
- Hi!

02:20:00.511 --> 02:20:02.115
Thanks for coming.
- How are you, dear?

02:20:03.678 --> 02:20:05.013
Coach sir!

02:20:08.819 --> 02:20:09.872
Good.

02:20:10.779 --> 02:20:11.848
Hello, uncle!

02:20:12.313 --> 02:20:15.515
Why did you grow
a beard like your dad?

02:20:18.046 --> 02:20:20.622
You went there to study for 2 years,
but stayed back.

02:20:20.832 --> 02:20:23.341
Then you took your mom too.

02:20:24.189 --> 02:20:25.956
Don't you want any of us?

02:20:27.043 --> 02:20:28.807
I'll finish the project
by the end of this year, uncle.

02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:30.543
Then I'll come back
to Hyderabad office.

02:20:31.448 --> 02:20:32.667
Hey, Nani!

02:20:34.953 --> 02:20:36.365
How are you?
- How are you?

02:20:37.874 --> 02:20:38.919
Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.

02:20:38.999 --> 02:20:41.145
Hello. How are you?
- We think about Arjun every day.

02:20:41.225 --> 02:20:43.145
Thank you.
- Excuse me.

02:20:44.132 --> 02:20:45.692
I need to speak
to you for 2 minutes.

02:20:45.772 --> 02:20:49.002
We have a meeting.
You can speak to him after that.

02:20:50.026 --> 02:20:52.316
It's okay, uncle. Go ahead.
I'll talk to him and join you.

02:20:53.495 --> 02:20:54.555
Come with me.

02:20:55.103 --> 02:20:56.735
After reading the book about Arjun

02:20:56.968 --> 02:20:58.712
I thought you don't know the truth.

02:20:59.642 --> 02:21:02.915
As a doctor, I'm not
supposed to talk to everyone.

02:21:03.623 --> 02:21:06.399
I found out you were coming today,
so I came to meet you.

02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:13.958
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:18.238
No matter how great a man is

02:21:18.482 --> 02:21:22.175
no matter how many
great things he achieves

02:21:23.096 --> 02:21:25.520
someone has to write
about him to make him

02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:27.874
a part of history.

02:21:28.392 --> 02:21:31.460
We couldn't recognize the
greatness of one of our own men.

02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:33.232
Ramya wrote a book
about that great man

02:21:33.312 --> 02:21:35.136
and made him known to all of us.

02:21:35.781 --> 02:21:39.160
I'd like to thank her on
behalf of our cricket association.

02:21:44.588 --> 02:21:47.066
We are all so obsessed with success.

02:21:47.392 --> 02:21:50.273
Our eyes are always focused
on successful people.

02:21:50.353 --> 02:21:54.088
Not just with cricket,
but in every aspect of life.

02:21:54.317 --> 02:21:56.173
We always want to
know more about people

02:21:56.253 --> 02:21:57.765
who are very successful.

02:21:58.090 --> 02:22:00.022
But not everyone achieves success.

02:22:00.224 --> 02:22:01.913
Only one out of 100 finds it.

02:22:02.231 --> 02:22:05.124
Arjun's story is not about

02:22:05.204 --> 02:22:07.042
that one man out of
100 who finds success.

02:22:08.129 --> 02:22:12.353
It is about those
99 men who kept trying.

02:22:17.338 --> 02:22:21.645
After reading this book,
I tried to find out

02:22:21.725 --> 02:22:25.197
what happened after that match,
like many of you did.

02:22:26.298 --> 02:22:29.871
I have the privilege to
access the old BCCI documents.

02:22:32.461 --> 02:22:36.186
This is the list of players
who were selected for Indian team

02:22:36.622 --> 02:22:40.596
for the England Tour
after 1996 Ranji finals.

02:22:41.829 --> 02:22:43.131
And...

02:22:45.214 --> 02:22:48.656
You know, Arjun got selected
for Indian team for England.

02:22:59.089 --> 02:23:02.607
I'd like to call Arjun's
son to come on to the stage please.

02:23:03.291 --> 02:23:06.213
We have something from the
BCCI to present to the family.

02:23:06.878 --> 02:23:08.083
Go.

02:23:15.803 --> 02:23:17.507
This is for you.

02:23:45.134 --> 02:23:47.474
'Will you really buy a jersey?'

02:23:47.554 --> 02:23:51.345
'If you keep your hand on my
head and say it it's like a promise.'

02:23:51.425 --> 02:23:53.949
'I crossed my fingers too.'

02:23:54.029 --> 02:23:57.427
'You can't break the promise now.'

02:24:16.053 --> 02:24:17.622
Please.

02:24:19.843 --> 02:24:21.110
Thank you.

02:24:24.132 --> 02:24:27.393
This is the birthday gift
I had asked my dad 23 years ago

02:24:28.610 --> 02:24:31.557
when I was just 7 years old.

02:24:34.016 --> 02:24:36.708
My dad's determination
was so great that

02:24:37.664 --> 02:24:40.837
I got the gift I wanted
even after so many years.

02:24:51.501 --> 02:24:54.814
After the Ranji
final match in Mumbai

02:24:55.833 --> 02:24:57.982
my dad was admitted in the hospital.

02:25:01.079 --> 02:25:04.618
He died of heart
failure after two days.

02:25:11.498 --> 02:25:14.805
And the doctors said that he has
a heart disease called Arrhythmia.

02:25:19.292 --> 02:25:20.654
I just found out that
my dad knew about it

02:25:22.112 --> 02:25:25.092
10 years before he died.

02:25:35.517 --> 02:25:38.664
In fact, when he was 26

02:25:40.391 --> 02:25:42.629
that was the reason
why my dad quit cricket.

02:25:46.341 --> 02:25:48.219
You have a heart condition
called Arrhythmia.

02:25:49.215 --> 02:25:50.872
Your heartbeat is irregular.

02:25:51.746 --> 02:25:55.225
So your heart might stop
with increased physical stress.

02:25:59.673 --> 02:26:03.989
You don't have to worry.
Just quit cricket.

02:26:04.697 --> 02:26:06.359
You won't have any
problem if you don't take

02:26:07.124 --> 02:26:10.070
physical stress and come
for regular checkups. Okay?

02:26:10.607 --> 02:26:11.943
Okay, doctor.

02:26:22.028 --> 02:26:23.397
Leave me alone, sir, please.

02:26:23.930 --> 02:26:24.999
Arjun!

02:26:29.199 --> 02:26:30.722
I want to quit cricket, Sarah.

02:26:32.838 --> 02:26:35.580
Now I have you.
That's enough for me.

02:26:38.044 --> 02:26:40.592
Dad, won't you play cricket again?

02:26:40.946 --> 02:26:43.428
You tell me. Should I play or not?

02:26:43.693 --> 02:26:47.842
You play very well.
You look like a hero.

02:27:09.574 --> 02:27:13.220
I'm telling you this because

02:27:15.294 --> 02:27:18.098
we all think that
my dad died trying.

02:27:20.039 --> 02:27:21.130
That's wrong.

02:27:22.188 --> 02:27:25.023
My dad kept trying even
when he knew he would die.

02:27:35.306 --> 02:27:36.442
That is my father!

02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:22.877
1996 BESANT NAGAR BEACH, CHENNAI.

02:28:26.122 --> 02:28:27.688
Ready?

02:28:35.805 --> 02:28:37.416
Dad, give me the camera.

02:28:37.555 --> 02:28:39.470
How many snaps will
we take with just two of us?

02:28:39.823 --> 02:28:41.865
There's not a single
one with all three of us.

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:43.777
We have the photos
from Shailu's weddings.

02:28:43.901 --> 02:28:45.455
But he wasn't born yet.

02:28:45.535 --> 02:28:46.571
But he was there, right?

02:28:48.968 --> 02:28:53.957
Dad, hold the camera like
this and click. We three will come.

02:28:54.037 --> 02:28:56.443
Dad, do as I say, please.
- That's not how you click photos.

02:28:56.523 --> 02:28:58.588
We three will be there in it.
- If we want all of us in it...

02:28:59.229 --> 02:29:01.538
Please, dad. Do as I say.
- Nani, stop whining, please.

02:29:01.618 --> 02:29:03.453
