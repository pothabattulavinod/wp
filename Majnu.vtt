00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.347
Majnu (2016)

00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:07.686
Alcohol consumption and smoking is injurious to health.

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:09.669
Now should I say it in Telugu?

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.421
Alcohol consumption and smoking is injurious to health.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.130
Majnu

00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:58.726
Camera roll, background action.

00:03:59.084 --> 00:04:00.886
Jimmy

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.086
Action!

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:04.922
Horse entry.

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:09.902
Soldiers enter.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.160
The hero enters.

00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:28.521
Aditya, say the dialogues.

00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:30.091
Let someone else do it ..

00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:31.729
Why should I say ...

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.130
How can I be so special?

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.744
Tell a dialogue of this movie.

00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:41.996
Spectators are not allowed on the battlefield.

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:44.724
Whoever took this sword ....

00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:50.343
Without permission .... permission ....

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:01.746
Here it must be said correctly.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.298
Aditya, come here.

00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:03.711
Sir.

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:06.856
Sir.
- Do you know what the dialogue was like?

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:08.765
Thank you sir.

00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:10.216
The people of our village say the same thing.

00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:12.650
That I'm a natural actor sir.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.556
I like to manage. Please do not insist.

00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:21.082
Go and talk to the actors, where is Prabhas?

00:05:21.082 --> 00:05:21.733
In the car, sir.

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:23.026
Tamanna?
- In the car, sir.

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.652
Tamanna is in the car, sir.

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:27.930
Don't try to show me this nonsense of yours.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.370
Go talk to the actors.

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:31.966
I didn't say shake my head, go ....

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.166
Shots ready,
Hey, the shots are ready.

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:35.214
Shall I remove these, sir?

00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:38.261
No, it doesn't have to be.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:39.700
Ah! Get ready.

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:42.012
Hey! How much longer? Shots ready, send them quickly.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.530
Hello!
- Come on, come on, save me.

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.193
Otherwise, these thugs will kill me today.

00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:48.931
Where's the thug?

00:05:49.046 --> 00:05:50.347
Not going to meet a girl?
What happened?

00:05:50.372 --> 00:05:51.543
Will discuss that later.

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.780
If you haven't come now, you must come to burn my body.

00:05:54.447 --> 00:05:55.431
They are always ...

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.798
Well, send your location to WhatsApp.
- All right.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.303
Where is my car?
- I don't know, brother.

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:56.262
Reached the destination?

00:06:56.362 --> 00:06:58.185
Hey, don't leave.
Cut!

00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:02.630
If it is 'cut', it is not leaving.

00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:09.041
The chariot of arm sacrifice from Bahubali.
- Yeah, same bro.

00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:11.553
Seeing their reaction, it seems they are crazy movie fans.

00:07:11.553 --> 00:07:13.733
Then let's handle the case without sweating.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:15.557
Fighting is not always important in shooting.

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:18.179
Who? Where are they? Where?

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:19.971
We needed four at the last minute, didn't we?
Where are they?

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:20.916
Which four?

00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:22.987
They.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.710
With Prabhas in the last part.

00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:34.562
Will they work?

00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:36.561
Hmmm, when they chased me,

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.744
They were screaming and running well.

00:07:39.744 --> 00:07:43.179
Sona Sood, Sudip, Om Puri are calling these characters and shaking their heads.

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:44.299
Om is dead, isn't he?

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:45.582
Ah that was Amaresh Puri?

00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:47.870
Boss, are you a relative of MGR?

00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:51.840
Bahubali is the assistant director of cinema.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.635
Rajmouli sir can not be our own?

00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:53.855
Hey!

00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.825
Do you know who wore the yellow dhoti of Bahubali?

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:59.251
Prabhas wears a yellow dhoti while in the film.

00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:00.864
Does anyone know why Katappa killed Bahubali?

00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:02.158
I know? .... You know? ... You know?

00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:05.019
He knows ... Who was the protagonist of the movie 'Makshi'?

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:05.941
He.

00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:07.775
It's been a long time.
- No, it didn't.

00:08:07.775 --> 00:08:10.546
Boss, give us a chance to act in Bahubali.

00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:12.784
No need to give a character like Prabhas, boss.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.072
Your hair is beautiful, you can be taken in the role of heroine.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.003
Excuse me, and tell me who was chasing you?

00:08:18.003 --> 00:08:19.130
Boss

00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:20.918
Not so much, he was violating his limits.

00:08:21.018 --> 00:08:24.066
- What's the limit?
- It's fine, boss.

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.887
Is that so?
- Hmm, that's right.

00:08:26.887 --> 00:08:29.300
All right, come on.

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:34.085
What can you do?
Fight, boss.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.168
- Can you fight?
- Hmm.

00:08:34.168 --> 00:08:37.030
Very good!
Let's see!

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.130
- Come on.
- Come back.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.112
Brother, give me two.

00:08:47.821 --> 00:08:49.579
Hey, what are you doing?

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:06.848
There was a storm.

00:09:06.848 --> 00:09:07.245
Boss!

00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:08.456
Wasn't it like a storm?
- Yes, boss.

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:10.360
Was like '96 with a Russian angle bro.

00:09:10.385 --> 00:09:11.508
What was the Russian angle?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.050
I see everyone is an expert in cinema. Let's go.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.377
What is this?
- Fight, boss.

00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:21.524
Have you been fighting for so many years?
Everything should look normal.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.229
Got it? All right.

00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:28.255
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.

00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:38.917
Hey! Be careful.

00:09:39.017 --> 00:09:40.592
Yes, Mr. Kiroyani will not leave.

00:09:40.692 --> 00:09:43.774
Hey, the director of the song ... the director of the song, look.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.098
For a long time, they were beaten
Let's stop now.

00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.696
Hey, hey, hey!

00:09:50.796 --> 00:09:52.523
Stop.

00:09:54.591 --> 00:09:57.026
Very good. I was very impressed.

00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:00.206
- Keep in touch.
- Boss, give me the phone number.

00:10:00.636 --> 00:10:02.524
I will contact if necessary.

00:10:02.624 --> 00:10:04.208
Let's go.

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:05.452
- Goodbye bro.
- Take care.
- Nice fight.

00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:07.494
Okay, it took this long, time to go.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.249
You go, I was following that girl.

00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:15.889
If you come with me, I'll have courage, please.

00:10:18.836 --> 00:10:20.449
Must be a little lighter.

00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:22.287
Where is the girl?

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:26.235
Look, the real movie has started.

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:58.003
Why are you looking at him like this?

00:10:58.103 --> 00:11:01.618
Like a morning show's start, very nice.

00:11:02.303 --> 00:11:03.716
Okay do whatever you want.

00:11:04.153 --> 00:11:06.641
I like that girl. I followed her.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.037
Thanks bud.

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:13.158
You're a real friend.

00:11:13.258 --> 00:11:16.236
Now you have to write a good story about this beautiful girl.

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:19.182
I need to know the details about this girl, I will write it.

00:11:19.207 --> 00:11:20.764
It works in our office.

00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:21.607
Shall I find out?

00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:23.335
- I mean, sir.
- Who are you?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.817
My name is Ramkuti.

00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:26.196
I live in Kinkutti.

00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:28.226
Learn one, but do another.

00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:30.895
My goal is to find a millionaire anyway.
What's the matter

00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:32.476
Sir, I am Madam Jhuma's driver.

00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:34.436
If you google about madam,

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:36.111
Then you can't hear better from me.

00:11:36.136 --> 00:11:37.510
Please tell ..

00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:38.704
500 rupees?

00:11:38.729 --> 00:11:40.507
What's retail? This is not 500 notes.

00:11:40.817 --> 00:11:42.897
In fact,

00:11:43.047 --> 00:11:45.301
Our madam loves to hear love stories.

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:46.690
But do not believe in love,

00:11:46.715 --> 00:11:48.414
- Don't believe it?
- Not at all.

00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:49.996
When someone falls in love with Madame,

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:52.417
Madame climbed him on her feet.

00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:53.894
Do not give the opportunity to bow in front of anyone.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.201
Hey,
Your madam doesn't have a boyfriend?

00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:56.359
No, no.

00:11:56.384 --> 00:11:58.574
Love is impossible for Madam Jhuma.

00:11:58.674 --> 00:11:59.584
Sir, don't waste your time.

00:11:59.684 --> 00:12:02.035
I wanted to know the details, I didn't want to hear your instructions.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.714
Now I will handle it.

00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:04.372
Go.

00:12:04.863 --> 00:12:07.260
Sir, sir, try to understand.

00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:09.502
If you give 1 thousand more, I will tell the details.

00:12:09.527 --> 00:12:12.058
Otherwise you will face many more problems.
- Uh?

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.180
- You just want more money?
- Yes, Yes

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.349
In the meantime, he has started composing his story.

00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:18.308
Now the story will change with the character.

00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:20.886
Three days later, your madam will come and love my friend. Wait.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.435
Thanks.

00:12:35.612 --> 00:12:36.872
Excuse me.

00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:39.943
I'm waiting for you
You look like a girl I know.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.629
What's the girl's name?

00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:46.718
- Priya.
- Then I'm not her, thank God.

00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:48.446
Your eyes are very beautiful.

00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:50.325
It was a good try,

00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:52.669
But I am not interested in all this.
Sorry.

00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:54.279
Your voice is beautiful too.

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:56.242
Hello. I'm not interested.

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.315
What? You didn't like that?

00:12:57.415 --> 00:12:59.708
I have Prabhas, Mahesh all in me,

00:12:59.808 --> 00:13:00.645
Still you don't like?

00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:01.672
What am I missing?

00:13:01.772 --> 00:13:04.543
There is no brain inside the head.  What else?

00:13:04.643 --> 00:13:07.044
Main road was congested, you're already here.

00:13:07.144 --> 00:13:08.704
Ordered food?

00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:11.206
Your brother? What's he doing here?

00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:13.864
Hi, brother in law.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.897
My brother in law is angry. you're welcome

00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:22.162
Do you want thanks now?

00:13:22.262 --> 00:13:24.834
So why are you sitting here?

00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:28.735
If I leave you will be alone. But brother in law will not leave you alone.

00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:30.166
Well, then what are your next plans?

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:34.333
I want to be friends and enjoy your company.

00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:35.425
Okay.

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.620
My name is Aditya and I am an assistant director of cinema.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.307
Do I have to tell you my name and details now?

00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:42.045
No need. You don't have to talk.

00:13:42.145 --> 00:13:44.109
- Thank you very much.
- Your name?

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:46.154
You just said I didn't have to tell you my name.

00:13:46.254 --> 00:13:47.778
You don't have to tell the truth, you can lie.

00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:49.097
Shall I lie?

00:13:49.197 --> 00:13:52.469
I'll find out from your girlfriend.

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.699
My name is Kareena Kapoor.

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.035
My friends call me Saif.

00:13:58.417 --> 00:13:59.798
Hobby?

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.184
Walking the streets during the day,

00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:04.674
And talking to people like you ..

00:14:04.774 --> 00:14:06.446
Much more.

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:08.254
Your smile is very beautiful.

00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:11.304
Don't take it for granted.

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:15.368
- Your girlfriend is coming.
-Yes.

00:14:15.468 --> 00:14:17.071
Nice to meet you, thank you.

00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:18.416
You have to tell the truth.

00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:20.070
- What truth?
- Your name is Jhuma.

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:25.485
Your phone number is 9885027683.

00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:27.918
Your hobbies are watching movies and listening to music.

00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:29.645
How do you know all this?

00:14:30.977 --> 00:14:33.126
I know a lot more about you.

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:35.727
Tomorrow evening is your girlfriend Nisha's birthday party.

00:14:35.827 --> 00:14:37.897
You go there, and it ends at 9:30.

00:14:37.997 --> 00:14:40.086
Then we will meet at the same hotel.

00:14:40.186 --> 00:14:42.044
Then I will tell you everything.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.850
Hi, Kirthi! Nice to meet you

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.196
Hey, your smile is really beautiful.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.101
Goodbye Jhuma.

00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:49.561
Goodbye Kirthi.

00:14:50.407 --> 00:14:51.994
Who is he?

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.648
How do you know me

00:14:59.748 --> 00:15:01.453
Did you come here to find out?

00:15:01.553 --> 00:15:03.199
Don't think yourself so clever, okay?

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:05.694
And said you will come at 9:30, what time is it now?

00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:09.056
To surprise you, I was preparing myself a little ...

00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:12.185
In such short time how will you impress me?

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:14.340
That's why I told you to come here today,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.844
Tell me all the details about me.

00:15:15.944 --> 00:15:17.258
Do you have a girlfriend

00:15:17.358 --> 00:15:19.089
Had one.

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:21.481
Not now?

00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:24.522
All right. Let's hear your love story.

00:15:24.622 --> 00:15:28.797
Once you know someone's name, then what does he do, where does he live?  Then you ask the love story.

00:15:28.897 --> 00:15:31.932
I want to know about your character, that's why.

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:33.624
So I want to know your love story.

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.833
You ask for something other than that, I'll tell you.

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:39.080
Don't talk too much, just say what you want to say.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.281
Well, what's the problem?

00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:42.669
Take a small bet?

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:43.835
Bet?

00:15:44.138 --> 00:15:49.223
In this we will play a game which means we will ask seven questions ...

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.446
Can't answer correctly,
All wrong answers must be given.

00:15:52.007 --> 00:15:55.713
If you win I will tell my love story.

00:15:55.813 --> 00:15:57.986
- Well, let's play.
-  What if you lose?

00:15:58.086 --> 00:15:59.112
What happens?

00:15:59.212 --> 00:16:01.196
I have to do what I say.

00:16:01.296 --> 00:16:02.652
All right.

00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:04.006
First question ...

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.731
How many eyes do you have?

00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:08.463
Four.

00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.544
How many feet?

00:16:11.644 --> 00:16:12.537
Four.

00:16:12.637 --> 00:16:14.184
Are you human

00:16:14.184 --> 00:16:15.976
No, Alien.

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.931
What strange answers. What are you doing?

00:16:18.031 --> 00:16:19.878
- People are eating.
- How many questions did I ask?

00:16:21.235 --> 00:16:22.730
Four questions about it.

00:16:24.897 --> 00:16:26.010
Sure?

00:16:25.867 --> 00:16:27.245
Yes.

00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:29.802
- Four.
- Sure, sure?

00:16:29.802 --> 00:16:32.682
Oh shit. I told you the right answer.

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:36.226
Drink tequila.

00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:37.183
I can't.

00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:39.468
You lose, drink.

00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:44.984
- Happy now?
- Come on.

00:16:45.914 --> 00:16:47.727
- Come quickly.
- Where are you going?

00:16:47.727 --> 00:16:51.851
Here.

00:16:53.173 --> 00:16:54.681
What is this?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.389
It starts now.

00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:59.275
Flash mob.

00:19:42.162 --> 00:19:43.317
Where are they?

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:45.625
Seeing your dance, everyone ran away.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.154
- Why are you beating me?
- I have to hit you some more. Stop.

00:19:51.535 --> 00:19:52.223
Listen.

00:19:52.223 --> 00:19:54.017
Hey, you didn't tell Jhuma that I was your friend.

00:19:54.017 --> 00:19:56.403
When she sees me here,
She will kill me.

00:19:57.016 --> 00:19:57.643
Hello!

00:19:57.668 --> 00:19:59.579
- Brother, I'm brother,
- Which brother?

00:19:59.607 --> 00:20:00.568
Brother Ganesh.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.528
Hey, I don't know any such Ganesha,
How do I know his brother?

00:20:02.553 --> 00:20:04.941
Brother, I ...

00:20:05.485 --> 00:20:08.715
Brother, you said give us a chance to act,
When to pay?

00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:09.992
Who gave me my number?

00:20:10.017 --> 00:20:11.921
We came to the office.

00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:13.242
You went to work,

00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:14.457
I came a long time ago.

00:20:14.482 --> 00:20:17.123
From today everyone will come, start ...

00:20:18.347 --> 00:20:19.086
Shooting 'Shooting' ...

00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:20.091
Can you say dialogue properly?

00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:22.027
Say dialogue, we can say.

00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:23.243
Guru ...

00:20:23.763 --> 00:20:25.813
What did you say? What did you say?

00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:29.346
Can a lower race compete with a higher caste?

00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:31.314
Bad idea?

00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:33.189
It is an assessment of heroism, not a social status.

00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:35.209
Or is it a caste assessment?

00:20:35.209 --> 00:20:37.229
When was your father Bardwaj born,

00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:39.576
Even more unjust to be born into this world,

00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:43.073
You were born and raised, what is your caste?

00:20:43.073 --> 00:20:46.271
Our great ancestor Shantanamudu,

00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:50.015
Wasn't he the son of Ganga?

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:52.064
What was his caste?

00:20:52.531 --> 00:20:54.034
You have to say it.

00:20:54.034 --> 00:20:56.419
Guruji, what did you say? What did you say?

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:58.764
Can a lower race compete with a higher caste?

00:20:58.764 --> 00:21:00.762
What a bad idea.

00:21:00.762 --> 00:21:04.204
What did he say?

00:21:04.204 --> 00:21:07.788
It is an assessment of heroism, not a social status.

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:10.201
Or is it a caste assessment?

00:21:10.201 --> 00:21:12.671
When was your father Bardwaj born?

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.177
Brother, this dialogue is a little difficult.

00:21:27.177 --> 00:21:28.522
Make it a little easier.

00:21:28.522 --> 00:21:30.871
You don't say? Keep rehearsing the dialogue

00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:32.552
and audition again, ok?

00:21:32.904 --> 00:21:35.769
They will eat me.

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.017
Hey! Kasi!

00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:38.412
Did your throat get sore?

00:21:39.022 --> 00:21:39.990
Hi!

00:21:40.057 --> 00:21:41.057
What are you doing here

00:21:41.082 --> 00:21:43.902
Kasi is my close friend, so I came to see him.

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:45.101
Hi!
-You!

00:21:45.134 --> 00:21:47.179
That means you are about me ....

00:21:47.204 --> 00:21:48.065
He did it all.

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.107
No, I'm not.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.307
Jhuma, Jhuma, Jhuma.

00:21:52.307 --> 00:21:53.279
Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:59.144
Come home tomorrow morning,
Then go for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a bottle.

00:21:59.144 --> 00:22:00.346
Well, that's fine.

00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:03.063
- Are you angry?
No, I'm furious.

00:22:03.063 --> 00:22:05.908
No, this time without any excuse I will tell you my complete love story.

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:08.640
Are you sure what you are saying? I need proof.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.466
Evidence?

00:22:10.466 --> 00:22:11.876
I will give proof.

00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:12.951
Where to meet?

00:22:12.951 --> 00:22:13.970
In the lounge tomorrow,

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.626
I can't go tomorrow, I have to go to the office.

00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:22.788
Hey Kasi

00:22:23.172 --> 00:22:24.843
- I came on time right?
- Great.

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:26.207
You asked me to bring evidence.

00:22:26.232 --> 00:22:27.039
Superb.

00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:31.944
Now you tell your love story.

00:22:32.123 --> 00:22:33.390
Looking forward to it,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.169
Tell me!

00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:39.056
Where to start ...

00:22:39.056 --> 00:22:41.098
Start from anywhere.

00:22:42.956 --> 00:22:45.170
Four years ago ...

00:22:45.616 --> 00:22:50.019
Vimavaram. (city) Friends gave a party.

00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:52.845
I got a job at Infosys when I finished my engineering studies.

00:22:52.845 --> 00:22:54.271
The family is very happy.

00:22:54.271 --> 00:22:57.711
Do you know Kasi? My childhood friend

00:22:57.711 --> 00:23:01.170
my best friend forever.

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:06.562
I think I will go to Bangalore and have a lot of fun.

00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:17.260
Then everything was fine, what I wanted is happening.

00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:18.231
But that day,

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:21.986
Little did I know that my life was about to take a new turn.

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:30.181
Is this true ...!

00:23:56.603 --> 00:23:58.301
Move!
lyrics

00:23:58.301 --> 00:24:02.413
Move!
lyrics

00:24:04.093 --> 00:24:05.607
Move ... Move.
lyrics

00:24:17.114 --> 00:24:18.114
Hey, Adi!

00:24:18.947 --> 00:24:20.018
Get up.

00:24:22.314 --> 00:24:27.050
This ... blood!
- Please, sorry.

00:24:30.562 --> 00:24:36.430
lyrics

00:24:36.655 --> 00:24:38.060
- Are you alright?
- Uncle, sorry sorry.

00:24:38.148 --> 00:24:39.926
He was learning to ride a bike for the first time.

00:24:40.028 --> 00:24:41.100
What uncle?

00:24:41.276 --> 00:24:43.102
Did you get this time to ride a bike?

00:24:43.127 --> 00:24:44.163
See how much it hurts.

00:24:44.188 --> 00:24:46.203
Wasn't there gear for you?

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.928
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:48.721
... hey!

00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:51.304
Tell this girl to go too.

00:24:51.304 --> 00:24:53.191
You sit in the car, I won't leave so easily.

00:24:53.216 --> 00:24:54.251
Hey, you get in the car.

00:24:54.251 --> 00:25:01.140
lyrics

00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:11.164
lyrics

00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:16.916
Doctor ... Doctor ...

00:25:17.038 --> 00:25:18.809
This compounder, call the doctor.

00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:19.809
Here I am the doctor.

00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:20.972
Sorry sir.

00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:23.281
Unfortunately, looking at your face, I thought you were a compounder.

00:25:24.575 --> 00:25:25.953
What? Fighting?

00:25:25.953 --> 00:25:28.343
No, he was injured in an accident.

00:25:30.438 --> 00:25:32.836
Dad, you said he was hurt.

00:25:33.353 --> 00:25:35.982
Why is he smiling when he is hurt?

00:25:35.982 --> 00:25:37.994
Is he crazy?

00:25:38.046 --> 00:25:40.466
Did your head hurt somewhere?

00:25:40.466 --> 00:25:42.207
See how he looks at me.

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:45.282
You hurt his hand.
So let it be.

00:25:47.988 --> 00:25:49.781
The patient must be admitted first,

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:51.630
You have to deposit 12000 rupees at the counter.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.657
Have 5000 in hand and the bill is 12000 rupees?

00:25:53.657 --> 00:25:54.814
You have to pay everything.

00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:56.845
Sorry, we don't really have the money.

00:25:56.845 --> 00:25:58.917
If I had known there would be injury, I would have left my bike at home.

00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:00.546
Ah, otherwise you would have killed people on the street like this.

00:26:00.546 --> 00:26:02.648
Uncle, I am a young man.

00:26:02.648 --> 00:26:04.361
Well, take care of him.

00:26:04.361 --> 00:26:05.953
I went to get money.

00:26:05.953 --> 00:26:08.013
Take care of yourself.

00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:37.812
I love you

00:26:42.763 --> 00:26:48.377
Nothing happened, I'll give you an injection, you'll feel tired and be fine.

00:27:13.194 --> 00:27:13.924
Are you ok now

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.432
Where is that girl?

00:27:15.761 --> 00:27:16.507
Which girl?

00:27:18.035 --> 00:27:19.638
The girl who hit me.

00:27:19.689 --> 00:27:22.975
Ah, that girl. She is gone.

00:27:23.481 --> 00:27:24.839
Did you take his number?

00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:26.856
Do you know his name?

00:27:26.856 --> 00:27:27.910
Why?

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.764
Are you in love?

00:27:29.764 --> 00:27:32.053
If you say it before,
Then I would keep his complete information.

00:27:32.564 --> 00:27:35.755
The girl got lost in the sun, and left me in the dark.

00:27:35.918 --> 00:27:39.164
Leaving Bangalore, Infosys for him
I started looking for her.

00:27:40.072 --> 00:27:43.199
My mother, who never made fun of me,
did today.

00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:47.933
Dad, whoever yells at me all the time
He stopped talking.

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:51.839
Anyway, I stopped drinking
and searched for her.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.064
I went around the city for the girl,

00:28:03.064 --> 00:28:05.591
And I realized how big the city!

00:28:05.591 --> 00:28:07.669
But I could not find the girl.

00:29:48.107 --> 00:29:49.996
Good morning, sir.

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:04.151
Good morning

00:30:04.791 --> 00:30:07.584
Sit down ...! Sit down ...! Sit down ...!

00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:13.122
Give me the textbook.

00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:18.902
The new teacher's voice is beautiful, isn't it?

00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:22.814
If someone like that teaches,
Then the class cannot be held for long.

00:30:22.814 --> 00:30:24.891
Well, that's fine. Let's start with the C program.

00:30:24.891 --> 00:30:27.395
As we already know,

00:30:27.914 --> 00:30:30.755
The work of a computer can only be done by binary code.

00:30:30.755 --> 00:30:36.234
Let's say I want you to do work in a particular way.

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.632
You have to use their language you understand.

00:30:37.632 --> 00:30:41.329
To understand C, you need to look at its subjugation first.

00:30:41.329 --> 00:30:42.440
Number one.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.454
See, sir.

00:30:43.454 --> 00:30:45.372
Windows systems, windows 9 ectetera.

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:48.171
I want all of you to note down what I have explained till now.

00:30:48.171 --> 00:30:50.051
What is happening Aditya?

00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:51.325
I missed you so much, sir.

00:30:51.325 --> 00:30:53.412
If you remember him, go to the teachers' room and meet him.

00:30:53.412 --> 00:30:55.284
Is it necessary to go to the classroom and teach?

00:30:55.284 --> 00:30:58.239
There was no one in the classroom, sir ...

00:30:58.239 --> 00:31:00.119
So, you will teach in this way empty handed?

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:04.800
Now the headmaster's chair is empty, will you sit down?

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.929
Sir, sir, sir you are losing your mental balance.

00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:09.531
Aditya, when you came to college,
So there are rules and regulations.

00:31:09.531 --> 00:31:11.154
However, your teaching skills are very good.

00:31:11.154 --> 00:31:11.698
Thank you, sir.

00:31:11.698 --> 00:31:12.348
Is it, sir?

00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:14.467
Are you recruiting him for teaching?

00:31:14.492 --> 00:31:15.601
Nothing like that, sir.

00:31:15.712 --> 00:31:17.950
If he wants, he can join as a junior lecturer.

00:31:17.975 --> 00:31:20.740
However, you complain all day long.

00:31:20.765 --> 00:31:23.644
When I said it was going to be more, you might as well increase the salary
And encourage.

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:25.757
I never thought you would ruin my job like that.

00:31:25.782 --> 00:31:28.926
Don't worry, sir.
You also have other tuitions.

00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:31.451
Aditya come quickly, and come and join us.

00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:35.132
Sir, you can't even think,
How much you have benefited me.

00:31:35.735 --> 00:31:37.193
I always support you.

00:31:37.193 --> 00:31:37.869
Thank you sir.

00:31:37.869 --> 00:31:38.959
Your salary is 10000 rupees.

00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:41.201
10000, thank you sir.

00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:43.666
All right.

00:31:46.348 --> 00:31:49.285
Finally the principal of this college gave you permission. to love

00:31:49.285 --> 00:31:50.596
and 10,000 salary.

00:31:51.021 --> 00:31:52.624
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:53.441
Why aren't you greeting?

00:31:54.364 --> 00:31:55.562
Good morning, you go.

00:31:57.166 --> 00:31:58.475
Ah, you're a teacher now, aren't you?

00:31:59.112 --> 00:32:00.921
My class time has started.

00:32:19.047 --> 00:32:24.056
You entered my heart,

00:32:24.103 --> 00:32:28.071
But why do I leave whenever I see

00:32:28.832 --> 00:32:33.289
You walk all night, you tell me sweet stories ..!

00:32:33.396 --> 00:32:37.396
But why are you leaving, when I come in the morning!

00:32:37.464 --> 00:32:38.996
Don't draw.

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:41.444
Don't draw!

00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:46.100
Don't kill me, in that beautiful face of yours,

00:32:46.636 --> 00:32:48.366
Don't laugh!

00:32:49.004 --> 00:32:50.813
Don't laugh!

00:32:51.668 --> 00:32:56.072
Don't deceive me with your beautiful smile, darling!

00:32:56.652 --> 00:33:01.143
You entered my heart,

00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:05.688
But why go away whenever I see,

00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:26.877
Don't you know how to encourage our players?

00:33:27.002 --> 00:33:28.026
Clap your hands

00:33:29.077 --> 00:33:34.061
Your false gaze made me think

00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:38.460
Don't look at me when I'm in front of you ...!

00:33:38.485 --> 00:33:42.783
When I come back, look at you again,

00:33:43.008 --> 00:33:47.271
Thousands of love messages in my heart!

00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.964
Look at it with one eye and then with two eyes, then you will understand everything!

00:33:52.683 --> 00:33:57.254
You entered my heart,

00:33:57.371 --> 00:34:01.482
But why go away whenever I see !!!

00:34:06.522 --> 00:34:08.538
Why can't we sit together?

00:34:08.538 --> 00:34:10.417
- Your mustache is dirty,
- Ah, leave it out.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.648
Definition of function,

00:34:22.673 --> 00:34:23.489
Who says?

00:34:23.514 --> 00:34:24.725
- Sir!
- Put your hands down.

00:34:24.773 --> 00:34:26.114
Who says, you say?

00:34:27.228 --> 00:34:29.886
Sir, why do you always ask girls?

00:34:29.886 --> 00:34:31.347
Is it wrong for boys to answer?

00:34:31.747 --> 00:34:33.390
A human being has two brains.

00:34:33.525 --> 00:34:35.081
Left side, right side.

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:37.511
The right brain is for creativity
The left side is for argument.

00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:39.106
Creativity enhances rationality.

00:34:39.106 --> 00:34:40.965
And lack of logic increases creativity.

00:34:40.965 --> 00:34:42.477
What are you missing now?

00:34:42.477 --> 00:34:43.260
Of rationality.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.810
- What did I get?
- Creativity.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.910
Got it? Now shut up and sit down.
Anyone else have any questions?

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.812
- No, sir.
- All right?

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.719
Whose name are you writing on the pages of this book?

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:14.469
Flying leaves tell me!

00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:18.232
That bright lip of yours also goes around.

00:35:18.232 --> 00:35:22.625
Will never leave me, so why so soon?

00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:27.098
Your shadow over me, keep that you ...

00:35:27.629 --> 00:35:31.972
This look enhances you, this shyness of yours

00:35:31.972 --> 00:35:36.305
Ah, what a shame, in that face of yours.

00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:40.977
No matter how much you hide it, I'll find it!

00:35:40.977 --> 00:35:45.153
If you don't talk to me, I will know more about you!

00:35:45.153 --> 00:35:49.059
I will know.

00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:53.656
I understand the meaning behind your eyes.

00:35:53.656 --> 00:35:57.982
I will know.

00:35:57.982 --> 00:36:03.073
I found the secret of your laughter, dear.

00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:15.451
Are you getting in line behind girls?

00:36:15.911 --> 00:36:16.737
Go to the classroom.

00:36:22.822 --> 00:36:24.298
Good morning, sir.

00:36:24.323 --> 00:36:26.300
Good morning ... sit down! Sit down!

00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:31.470
What do you lack today?

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.515
Fiance sir.

00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:34.614
Fiance?

00:36:34.614 --> 00:36:35.805
What did you say?

00:36:35.805 --> 00:36:37.292
What are you thinking ...

00:36:37.292 --> 00:36:39.462
Not interested in studying, but interested in all this ...

00:36:39.462 --> 00:36:41.585
A girl named Varalakshmi lived next door to us,
Who was as fickle as you.

00:36:42.347 --> 00:36:43.918
It takes seven years to pass engineering.

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:48.363
Stop this, shut up, sit down.

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:10.664
Didn't you come to college today?

00:37:11.799 --> 00:37:12.918
Who is this?

00:37:14.142 --> 00:37:15.515
Mom, this is our college teacher.

00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:17.817
- May I have a glass of water, Auntie?
- Yes, I do.

00:37:23.285 --> 00:37:24.429
The fiance has arrived?

00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:26.222
Sir, that's what she said.

00:37:30.971 --> 00:37:34.056
I mean, you know what I came to college for?

00:37:34.056 --> 00:37:36.476
- I know.
- You know what?

00:37:36.476 --> 00:37:38.815
I know C language.

00:37:39.678 --> 00:37:41.144
Got it.

00:37:41.144 --> 00:37:45.021
I understand, you understand.

00:37:45.021 --> 00:37:46.478
So, nobody is here?

00:37:46.478 --> 00:37:48.714
- No one, sir.
- Who lives here?

00:37:48.714 --> 00:37:51.967
It's mom, nobody else.

00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:53.617
Got it.

00:37:54.456 --> 00:37:56.036
Got it too.

00:38:03.568 --> 00:38:05.147
Auntie, the water was delicious.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.816
Well, that's fine.

00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:15.869
Can you move a little?

00:38:21.502 --> 00:38:23.962
Tomorrow morning, same time, same place.

00:38:26.044 --> 00:38:28.693
Stay away from her.

00:38:32.232 --> 00:38:34.711
Why did he tell you to go at the right time?

00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:37.293
You're coming to college tomorrow morning.

00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:48.973
- What happened?
- The scooter is being repaired.

00:38:49.213 --> 00:38:50.158
Come on.

00:38:50.293 --> 00:38:51.935
No, I'll walk.

00:38:58.233 --> 00:38:59.694
Okay, then I'll walk too.

00:39:00.094 --> 00:39:01.983
Why are you following me?

00:39:02.008 --> 00:39:05.362
I suspect you're deliberately saying your scooter is bad.

00:39:05.362 --> 00:39:07.616
What a shame, especially today.

00:39:07.616 --> 00:39:08.870
Nothing like that.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.445
Auto.

00:40:01.885 --> 00:40:03.100
You are right.

00:40:04.477 --> 00:40:05.945
It is better to walk on that foot.

00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:16.326
I have no money, you pay.

00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:28.839
All the elders follow him,

00:40:29.227 --> 00:40:30.838
Why in the auto today?

00:40:30.838 --> 00:40:32.656
The scooter has broken down.

00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:35.423
Sir, why in the auto?

00:40:35.423 --> 00:40:36.891
The car broke down.

00:40:38.694 --> 00:40:40.708
Don't understand?

00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:43.210
Wait seven years.

00:40:47.075 --> 00:40:48.972
Today is a romantic day.

00:40:49.629 --> 00:40:52.838
I have to talk today.

00:40:54.503 --> 00:40:57.956
This Devathi,  Devi and the girl in the yellow dress ..

00:40:58.764 --> 00:40:59.882
You go in and sit down and I will talk.

00:40:59.882 --> 00:41:01.649
Get get going.

00:41:09.778 --> 00:41:10.683
Devathi.

00:41:10.887 --> 00:41:11.498
Sir!

00:41:11.545 --> 00:41:13.361
Did you think I didn't know?

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:14.715
I know everything.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.381
Sir, sir don't call my father.

00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:19.220
That means something has happened.

00:41:20.133 --> 00:41:22.300
Okay, okay, don't do it again.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.592
Go.

00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:28.934
This devil is still there.

00:41:31.332 --> 00:41:32.268
Devi.

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:34.845
I'll talk to you later.

00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:38.238
Devathi is very sad, so go and see.

00:41:39.689 --> 00:41:41.078
Go and see.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.745
Can I start?

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.100
What happened?

00:42:30.221 --> 00:42:34.483
Ever since I came to college, no one has given me a chance to look.

00:42:35.709 --> 00:42:37.281
People around here.

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:38.979
That's why I had to do that.

00:42:38.979 --> 00:42:40.369
I'm going.

00:42:40.369 --> 00:42:46.018
The fundamentals of C and C++

00:42:46.018 --> 00:42:48.354
Do you understand?

00:42:48.354 --> 00:42:49.241
Mr. Janardhan Rao,

00:42:49.241 --> 00:42:50.366
Now is the time for your tuition,

00:42:50.366 --> 00:42:53.070
So, what are you doing here? Go
I am helping out a student.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.470
I see that.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.170
When we talk about tuition,
Then there is no importance.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.915
When you have a problem, you explain it to the student.

00:42:58.915 --> 00:43:01.173
I have never seen such a thing in my life.

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:13.082
When you came home yesterday,

00:43:13.107 --> 00:43:15.392
The mother asked, "How did he become a teacher at such a young age?"

00:43:15.417 --> 00:43:17.336
"Is he really a teacher?"

00:43:17.382 --> 00:43:18.874
Auntie has intelligence.

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:20.745
Then ..

00:43:20.745 --> 00:43:21.954
say the truth.

00:43:22.787 --> 00:43:24.848
Why not?

00:43:24.848 --> 00:43:26.203
I know ...

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:31.382
Export this equation in A minus C minus E is equal to.

00:43:33.153 --> 00:43:34.097
In your house ...

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.653
In college we are not independent,

00:43:36.843 --> 00:43:38.621
So we'll meet at the ice cream shop tomorrow at 10:30.

00:43:39.559 --> 00:43:42.893
See you at the ice cream shop at Gita Shopping Market at 10:30.

00:43:43.189 --> 00:43:45.324
- I'm not coming.
- Thanks.

00:43:45.462 --> 00:43:47.113
- I'm not coming.
- Tomorrow morning.

00:43:47.138 --> 00:43:48.480
- I'm not coming.
- 10:30 a.m.

00:43:48.254 --> 00:43:48.860
I'm not coming.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.595
- See you bye.
-  I'm not coming.

00:43:57.312 --> 00:43:59.823
Coming soon?

00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:02.631
You two keep talking, we'll meet.

00:44:05.244 --> 00:44:05.919
Hi!

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:07.625
How long will I wait?

00:44:07.782 --> 00:44:08.972
Sorry, it's too late ...

00:44:10.464 --> 00:44:12.805
You know, it's nice to hear you say, "I've been waiting for you for a long time."

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.345
Can't wait any longer?

00:44:19.843 --> 00:44:22.097
Well, pineapple is my favorite.

00:44:25.128 --> 00:44:25.763
What happened, who?

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:27.561
Don't look back, he's my brother.

00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:30.692
Brother, I mean brother in law...

00:44:32.054 --> 00:44:33.951
He notices my scooter and that's it.

00:44:37.796 --> 00:44:38.630
He left.

00:44:39.708 --> 00:44:40.843
Damn ashes!

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.581
He wandered from village to village till midnight and after that he was not seen.

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.548
I have many limitations in this life.

00:44:46.548 --> 00:44:48.264
In fact, why am I not born a boy?

00:44:48.264 --> 00:44:49.731
Because I was not born a girl,

00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:52.155
What would I do if you were born a boy?

00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:53.392
Don't joke

00:44:53.374 --> 00:44:54.183
What happened?

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:55.848
When I go out

00:44:55.873 --> 00:44:57.825
Every half-hour will call and ask where are you?

00:44:58.182 --> 00:45:01.177
One hour will remind you to say "be careful".

00:45:01.202 --> 00:45:04.711
If I don't get home in 5 minutes,
Then the parents will start preaching.

00:45:04.877 --> 00:45:06.012
One hour.

00:45:07.247 --> 00:45:08.700
There are 15 minutes ...

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.108
There is still a lot of time, nothing will happen.

00:45:15.288 --> 00:45:16.883
Leave it at that ...

00:45:16.908 --> 00:45:20.487
I fly like a bird and go somewhere.

00:45:23.661 --> 00:45:25.471
I have to go.

00:45:26.006 --> 00:45:27.018
Shall I come with? Quickly in my car ...

00:45:27.018 --> 00:45:28.802
On your bike? I'm not coming ...

00:45:28.802 --> 00:45:31.890
If anyone in the house sees me, I have finished studying engineering, goodbye.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:34.442
Not that,

00:46:09.764 --> 00:46:11.566
Hello! What happened again?

00:46:11.591 --> 00:46:12.589
Thus,

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.314
To find out what's going on at home.

00:46:15.478 --> 00:46:18.454
What will happen? An hour late,
I'll be back in half an hour.

00:46:18.479 --> 00:46:19.652
Ahhh! ok.

00:46:19.865 --> 00:46:22.508
Let's meet tomorrow.

00:46:22.508 --> 00:46:24.385
Tomorrow? What's tomorrow?

00:46:24.385 --> 00:46:25.527
Tomorrow is Rambabu's son's birthday.

00:46:25.527 --> 00:46:26.752
Who is he?

00:46:26.752 --> 00:46:28.805
One teacher said, I am.

00:46:28.984 --> 00:46:31.952
I'm going to hang up, try to get some sleep.

00:46:31.952 --> 00:46:33.078
Really, I'm not lying.

00:46:33.078 --> 00:46:34.469
This is really my birthday tomorrow.

00:46:34.469 --> 00:46:37.408
Come to college early tomorrow and wish me.

00:46:37.408 --> 00:46:39.010
All right? Goodbye.

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:41.617
Goodbye!

00:46:41.617 --> 00:46:44.125
- Won't you say bye?
- Bye bye.

00:46:48.143 --> 00:46:48.992
Mom!

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:53.801
Happy birthday

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.539
Thanks, where is my gift?

00:46:55.539 --> 00:46:57.273
It's a big thing that I'm here.

00:47:00.248 --> 00:47:01.773
Come on, I'll surprise you.

00:47:01.773 --> 00:47:02.920
What?

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.462
Nothing so amazing.

00:47:04.462 --> 00:47:05.232
Get on the bike.

00:47:05.232 --> 00:47:06.638
- And college?
- skip.

00:47:06.638 --> 00:47:07.935
What if the mother comes from home to find?

00:47:07.935 --> 00:47:08.656
How would she?

00:47:08.656 --> 00:47:12.100
You're in college now, and you'll be in college until college is over, I'll take care of it.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.985
How do you know what you're doing at the moment?

00:47:13.985 --> 00:47:16.576
- No one knows?
- Of course not.

00:47:17.186 --> 00:47:19.095
Put the fear in your bag,

00:47:19.095 --> 00:47:22.418
And the bag is inside it.

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.715
What happened?

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:52.556
Thanks Adi, this day was the best of my life.

00:51:52.556 --> 00:51:55.442
It was more than a dream to become a bird and fly somewhere.

00:51:55.442 --> 00:51:57.516
You showed me such a beautiful world.

00:51:57.516 --> 00:51:59.490
I will never forget this day.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:06.697
Thank you so much.

00:52:17.245 --> 00:52:17.967
Hello!

00:52:18.425 --> 00:52:19.258
Aditya!

00:52:19.575 --> 00:52:21.616
What is going on between us?

00:52:23.548 --> 00:52:24.556
You don't know?

00:52:24.581 --> 00:52:27.150
I understand Aditya, for which I am afraid.

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:30.076
I do not understand what is wrong and what is right.

00:52:31.007 --> 00:52:33.769
I can't find the answer to this question ...

00:52:33.769 --> 00:52:35.887
I will give you this letter.

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.529
There is something inside this book.

00:52:51.285 --> 00:52:52.094
Read that

00:52:57.863 --> 00:52:59.148
Excuse me Aditya.

00:53:00.939 --> 00:53:02.392
I want to talk to you.

00:53:07.007 --> 00:53:09.436
Read Chapter 24, I'm coming.

00:53:09.499 --> 00:53:10.158
All right.

00:53:17.367 --> 00:53:19.461
What happened today?
Anyone who is always afraid to talk ...

00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:23.066
Today went straight to the teachers' room.

00:53:26.932 --> 00:53:28.376
I love you, Aditya.

00:53:29.374 --> 00:53:32.608
I fell in love with you before I gave you the letter.

00:53:32.967 --> 00:53:34.944
But after reading this,

00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:37.610
I understand how much you love me

00:53:41.125 --> 00:53:44.528
I never thought I would love someone.

00:53:44.553 --> 00:53:46.733
I never thought anyone would love me more than me.

00:53:46.733 --> 00:53:49.118
From this moment on I want nothing in this world.

00:53:49.118 --> 00:53:51.632
It doesn't matter if my family knows about it.

00:53:51.632 --> 00:53:53.132
Let everyone say whatever they want.

00:53:53.132 --> 00:53:54.877
Just you will be enough, Aditya.

00:53:54.877 --> 00:53:56.011
I love you

00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:57.708
Just you will be enough, Aditya.

00:53:57.708 --> 00:53:58.346
I love you

00:53:58.346 --> 00:54:01.349
You are enough for me, I love you.

00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:04.386
You are enough for me, I love you.

00:54:22.827 --> 00:54:24.026
Very nice.

00:54:24.214 --> 00:54:25.031
But,

00:54:26.047 --> 00:54:28.087
What was written in the letter?

00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:29.704
Aditya!

00:54:33.446 --> 00:54:34.446
Are you okay?

00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:40.091
Aditya!

00:54:40.547 --> 00:54:41.579
Aditya!

00:55:05.926 --> 00:55:07.725
The day I saw you,

00:55:07.725 --> 00:55:08.740
The day I was born again.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:13.492
Because from then on, I started to think,
A life before you come,

00:55:13.517 --> 00:55:16.099
There was nothing special in my life before you came.

00:55:16.099 --> 00:55:19.284
Ever since you came, every moment of my day has seemed fascinating.

00:55:19.284 --> 00:55:23.870
Until now, I had hoped for something big in my life.
But now I want to walk holding your hand.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:27.523
When you laugh and the fight stops for love,

00:55:27.523 --> 00:55:33.841
I will be able to face any war then for the sake of laughter.

00:55:33.841 --> 00:55:36.746
It is impossible to say how much I will earn in the future.

00:55:36.746 --> 00:55:40.725
But every day I will try to keep happy from the last moment.

00:55:40.725 --> 00:55:42.719
I will give you strength from behind,

00:55:42.719 --> 00:55:44.942
I will carry you from the front and take you through the problem.

00:55:44.942 --> 00:55:46.485
You will take care you like a mother.

00:55:46.485 --> 00:55:48.509
I don't know how much to win in life,

00:55:48.509 --> 00:55:50.880
But I can go any distance for you.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.480
I will cross any sea,

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.167
I can climb any sky,

00:55:54.167 --> 00:55:55.897
Because you are my life.

00:55:55.897 --> 00:55:57.798
I can't imagine a moment without you.

00:55:57.798 --> 00:56:00.525
You are my life, and this life is in my hands now.

00:56:00.525 --> 00:56:04.004
Do as you wish. Yours, Aditya.

00:56:08.077 --> 00:56:09.878
Why did you call me, Jhuma?

00:56:09.903 --> 00:56:12.378
Aditya loved so much,

00:56:12.378 --> 00:56:14.849
What happened between them?

00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:15.880
This ...

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.333
Why are they different?

00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:19.146
I was the reason for their separation.

00:56:19.146 --> 00:56:20.475
Were you

00:56:20.475 --> 00:56:23.624
And a year has passed since their love,

00:56:30.296 --> 00:56:31.330
Why so late?

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:33.441
Sorry I was late due to Kasi.

00:56:34.737 --> 00:56:36.279
Look, Kasi.

00:56:36.279 --> 00:56:37.608
How long have I been waiting?

00:56:37.608 --> 00:56:38.711
One minute,

00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:39.951
Hey Kasi.

00:56:39.951 --> 00:56:41.042
Hey, let's watch a movie.

00:56:41.042 --> 00:56:42.096
I'll be there.

00:56:50.243 --> 00:56:52.362
She loved Aditya very much.

00:56:52.362 --> 00:56:54.974
He did not want Aditya to hang out with me.

00:56:54.974 --> 00:56:57.137
I have a job in Bangalore.

00:56:57.137 --> 00:57:00.078
Listen to me, don't do this job without hands, a package for 10 lakhs.

00:57:00.078 --> 00:57:01.791
Don't waste your life with this love.

00:57:01.791 --> 00:57:03.649
You've already wasted 1 year.

00:57:04.224 --> 00:57:05.975
Hi! How are you

00:57:05.975 --> 00:57:09.531
I want to talk to Aditya, not you.

00:57:10.503 --> 00:57:11.995
Goodbye, see you in the evening.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:13.333
Why didn't you tell me?

00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:15.894
I have no focus on work.

00:57:16.087 --> 00:57:17.944
I didn't say anything your friend said.

00:57:16.238 --> 00:57:17.944
What do you mean

00:57:17.944 --> 00:57:21.141
He says your life is being ruined because of me.

00:57:21.141 --> 00:57:22.477
He didn't mean that.

00:57:22.477 --> 00:57:24.065
I know what he means.

00:57:24.065 --> 00:57:25.357
You shouldn't miss this job.

00:57:25.357 --> 00:57:26.110
Go to Hyderabad.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.584
I don't like

00:57:27.584 --> 00:57:28.812
I want to stay here.

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:32.649
Because you want to be with me?
And you want to sit with him every day and drink wine?

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.277
What are you talking about?

00:57:34.277 --> 00:57:36.317
You promised me not to smoke? So what is this today?

00:57:36.317 --> 00:57:37.852
Tried to quit.

00:57:37.852 --> 00:57:39.089
I smoke very little.

00:57:39.089 --> 00:57:40.306
You're here because of me,

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:42.302
But will not do what I say?

00:57:42.302 --> 00:57:43.318
Isn't it?

00:57:52.919 --> 00:57:54.157
That day, what happened,

00:58:00.248 --> 00:58:01.589
He is my friend

00:58:01.724 --> 00:58:03.399
If you come again I will kill and crush.

00:58:03.845 --> 00:58:05.084
Why are you doing this?

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.631
What happened? Why are you bleeding?

00:58:06.631 --> 00:58:08.456
- What are you doing here?
- Tell me what happened?

00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:09.395
A small quarrel ...

00:58:09.395 --> 00:58:11.420
What's the blood in a small fight?

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.602
What's the matter?

00:58:12.602 --> 00:58:15.655
Kasi falls in love with a girl, when his man arrives ...

00:58:15.655 --> 00:58:17.081
Love trap?

00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:18.191
Anyway, what does that matter to yoU?

00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:19.169
He is my friend

00:58:19.169 --> 00:58:22.320
Ah, yes friend, there is no friend other than these donkeys?

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.419
Hey, I'm not in the mood right now, get out of here.

00:58:24.419 --> 00:58:26.750
I'm not going, I'm not in the mood.

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:30.493
Do you want him or me? Decide now.

00:58:30.926 --> 00:58:32.894
Hey, let's go.

00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:37.422
Aditya was his world.

00:58:37.708 --> 00:58:40.534
But to Aditya, he was bigger than the earth.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:42.023
The girl couldn't stand it.

00:58:44.557 --> 00:58:46.860
I understand. You've already decided, right?

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.168
Yes.

00:58:48.614 --> 00:58:51.067
I'm leaving.

00:58:51.067 --> 00:58:52.572
I want friends, not you.

00:58:52.572 --> 00:58:54.359
Happy? Peace of mind?

00:58:54.359 --> 00:58:55.684
Do whatever you want.

00:58:55.684 --> 00:58:57.162
I'm done with you.

00:59:51.031 --> 00:59:53.214
Aditya has tried to explain a lot to her

00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:54.920
But none of it worked.

00:59:58.883 --> 00:59:59.771
No ...

01:00:01.459 --> 01:00:02.713
Just talk once

01:00:05.341 --> 01:00:08.579
He loved the girl so much that he couldn't stand it.

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:15.065
Aditya ...

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.494
Don't worry, I'm not here to apologize.

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:19.228
I'm saying goodbye.

01:00:20.236 --> 01:00:21.847
I came to this college just for you.

01:00:21.847 --> 01:00:23.616
From this village just for you.

01:00:23.616 --> 01:00:25.502
If i don't need you

01:00:25.502 --> 01:00:27.036
Then I have no need for this village and college.

01:00:27.036 --> 01:00:28.216
You are happy here.

01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:29.729
I won't bother you.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.163
Needless to say,

01:00:32.163 --> 01:00:34.364
Why did you come into my life?

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.606
If I knew that day you would break my heart,

01:00:37.456 --> 01:00:41.345
When you hit my arm, I thought you might hit me too.

01:00:42.504 --> 01:00:44.029
I don't know how I fell in love with you.

01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:46.979
I decided,

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:48.871
I don't want you anymore

01:00:50.349 --> 01:00:52.245
I will go far away from you.

01:00:52.179 --> 01:00:54.846
Where you can neither see nor hear me

01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:59.351
That's why I don't want any opinion from you.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:01.386
Goodbye

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.172
That day he moved to Hyderabad.

01:01:11.172 --> 01:01:13.116
No matter how much he changes,

01:01:13.116 --> 01:01:14.747
Yet he could not forget the girl.

01:01:14.747 --> 01:01:16.897
Losing everything, he started getting drunk.

01:01:16.897 --> 01:01:17.929
Then he,

01:01:17.929 --> 01:01:19.540
Start watching movies,

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.154
Eventually, he was hired as an assistant director in the film industry.

01:01:23.154 --> 01:01:26.154
Again, he liked you.

01:01:26.154 --> 01:01:29.754
For which I had to make a sacrifice.

01:01:29.754 --> 01:01:30.705
What?

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.976
I said, this is a different story.

01:01:33.525 --> 01:01:34.970
Where is Aditya now?

01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:39.653
Congratulations! You're a finalist in love.

01:01:39.653 --> 01:01:42.910
Yeah I told her your love story, breakup, and everything else.

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.693
She was looking for you, why is your phone off? When he was calling you.

01:01:45.693 --> 01:01:47.231
I made a mistake.

01:01:47.231 --> 01:01:49.567
- What's wrong?
- Shut up.

01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:53.085
Hey, Aditya, where are you?

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.847
Tell me what I'm asking, where are you?

01:01:54.934 --> 01:01:57.998
I'm at the train station, I have something to tell you.

01:01:58.023 --> 01:01:59.214
No Jhuma ...

01:01:59.294 --> 01:02:02.690
Aditya, I have to park the car, talking later, okay?

01:02:02.715 --> 01:02:05.327
Jhuma, Jhuma, you stay there, I'm coming.

01:02:05.712 --> 01:02:07.791
- What happened?
- Come on.

01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:11.829
What are you talking about?

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.378
Yes, Jhuma is just an attraction, not love.

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:14.704
What is this? What will Jhuma say after hearing this?

01:02:14.704 --> 01:02:15.628
I will say, I still love Kiran

01:02:15.628 --> 01:02:16.721
What?

01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:20.782
That's right I love Kiran. I want her.

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:24.215
I was in a hurry. If I could control myself for another 4 days, her anger would subside.

01:02:24.215 --> 01:02:26.525
I made a mistake, now I'm going to convince her.

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:28.598
- Will he understand?
- I don't know.

01:02:28.598 --> 01:02:31.016
I will do everything I need to do.

01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:32.276
Hey

01:03:11.419 --> 01:03:12.586
Aditya.

01:03:14.621 --> 01:03:15.955
I love you, Aditya.

01:03:18.318 --> 01:03:20.787
My feelings for you,

01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:22.565
I can't express.

01:03:26.313 --> 01:03:27.924
You are very special, Aditya.

01:03:28.574 --> 01:03:30.384
I fell in love with you

01:03:32.707 --> 01:03:34.817
Ah, sorry.

01:03:35.434 --> 01:03:37.684
Meet my boyfriend Aditya.

01:03:37.684 --> 01:03:39.868
This is my cousin Kiran.

01:03:41.422 --> 01:03:43.129
Hi!

01:03:44.056 --> 01:03:45.634
Hmmm ... hello!

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:02.195
Sorry madam, you left when I arrived.

01:04:02.261 --> 01:04:04.777
Didn't come when I left.

01:04:04.809 --> 01:04:06.674
Don't try to be cunning.

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.805
- Go, get their bags.
- All right.

01:04:15.076 --> 01:04:16.410
What's going on?

01:04:16.597 --> 01:04:18.366
You still don't understand what's going on,

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.771
Kiran Jhuma came in the car and then at Jhuma's house,

01:04:20.771 --> 01:04:23.573
Come on Aditya, let me introduce you to my parents.

01:04:24.096 --> 01:04:25.748
Suddenly ...

01:04:25.748 --> 01:04:28.611
Yes.  I was late to confess my love for you.

01:04:28.611 --> 01:04:32.069
But I was too happy not to tell my family.

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:33.975
They want to meet you. Let's go.

01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:35.833
- Mom!
- I can't ... I'm gone

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:37.245
Where are you going? Come on in.

01:04:37.245 --> 01:04:38.114
No.

01:04:38.114 --> 01:04:39.525
Kiran!

01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:40.859
Kiran.

01:04:40.859 --> 01:04:42.080
Kiran how are you?

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:42.973
Yes, good.

01:04:42.973 --> 01:04:44.376
How are your parents

01:04:44.376 --> 01:04:45.348
Good.

01:04:45.537 --> 01:04:46.838
Why did you ask me?

01:04:46.962 --> 01:04:48.985
Sir, you are great.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.779
Changed the story well.

01:04:51.124 --> 01:04:53.711
Little did I know that the story would turn out so beautifully.

01:04:54.836 --> 01:04:57.138
Well, I'll take care of your story.

01:04:57.138 --> 01:04:59.616
Come on, no one will see.

01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:02.439
Hello.

01:05:02.439 --> 01:05:03.320
- Mom, Dad
- Hello.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.251
This is Aditya,

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:05.008
- Hello
- Welcome.

01:05:05.008 --> 01:05:05.872
Nice to meet you.

01:05:05.872 --> 01:05:08.116
Jhuma says everything about you.

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:09.473
- Come on in.
- Please Come in.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:09.969
Come on,

01:05:09.969 --> 01:05:11.258
- Coming,
- Come on Aditya.

01:05:11.258 --> 01:05:12.419
Come on.

01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:17.902
- Eat
- Take this.

01:05:20.518 --> 01:05:22.400
We're leaving,

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.665
Hey, what is this? It's too late, eat dinner.

01:05:25.665 --> 01:05:28.653
Not today ...
Another day ...

01:05:28.653 --> 01:05:32.719
No.The first time you came to our house, not feeding you would be wrong.

01:05:32.719 --> 01:05:35.357
Feel at home. I'll be back. Come on Mom.

01:05:35.357 --> 01:05:36.982
Please feel comfortable.

01:05:43.224 --> 01:05:44.935
- Is he a groom?
- Yes, yes.

01:05:45.539 --> 01:05:46.603
Come on, come on ...

01:05:46.636 --> 01:05:47.574
What is this?

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:51.708
Do I look like a groom or like Dipzol?

01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:53.782
Don't worry

01:05:54.137 --> 01:05:55.184
Don't worry, I'm scared.

01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:56.480
Why?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.363
Inside, two sisters are talking about you ...

01:05:59.363 --> 01:06:01.759
How do you think Aditya is a good man?

01:06:01.759 --> 01:06:04.195
How did I say that?

01:06:04.195 --> 01:06:06.088
And do you know about Aditya?

01:06:06.088 --> 01:06:09.551
Say good or bad, he is very good.

01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:12.138
He told me everything,

01:06:12.138 --> 01:06:16.240
His love, his life.
He is really genuine.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.891
When I start a relationship with boys, I realize ...

01:06:19.891 --> 01:06:22.161
Everyone can be, but not Aditya.

01:06:24.742 --> 01:06:27.212
- Don't you think it's weird?
- I understand.Kiran

01:06:27.212 --> 01:06:29.315
You once had a love story, didn't you?

01:06:29.315 --> 01:06:31.335
He left you, didn't he?

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.884
Aditya not the same as the guy you knew.

01:06:37.487 --> 01:06:41.163
I love his honesty.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.972
I'm showing you something

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.209
- What is she showing?
- What is she showing?

01:06:56.119 --> 01:06:57.000
My letter.

01:07:00.268 --> 01:07:02.484
There will be chaos again.

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:08.936
The girl who left him you love him so much?

01:07:08.936 --> 01:07:10.990
That girl was an ass.

01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:13.946
Aditya doesn't want to think about that girl now.

01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:17.093
And then she gets stressed, she tells her love story.

01:07:17.093 --> 01:07:18.583
Ours now, hi!

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:19.699
Hi!

01:07:19.699 --> 01:07:20.546
-Hi
-Hi!

01:07:20.546 --> 01:07:21.322
What are you doing?

01:07:21.322 --> 01:07:23.772
Come on, come on, I was going to talk to you.

01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:25.454
- Dinner is ready. Sit down.

01:07:26.619 --> 01:07:29.899
Aditya, Kiran was asking about you,

01:07:31.591 --> 01:07:33.480
You look upset, why?

01:07:34.633 --> 01:07:38.323
No, I mean ... I don't want to tell everyone my past.

01:07:38.323 --> 01:07:41.321
Jhuma, after we told you the past, we realized,

01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:42.487
How much you love Jhuma.

01:07:42.487 --> 01:07:44.602
Which is why we accepted it,

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:47.996
Shit! This will end my marriage ..

01:07:47.996 --> 01:07:49.181
Yes, of course.

01:07:49.181 --> 01:07:51.378
Careful.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.201
The vegetables are very good.

01:07:55.535 --> 01:07:56.939
- Dad,
- Yes, dear.

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:59.227
Aditya tells me his love story,

01:07:59.227 --> 01:08:02.562
Now I have to talk about my past too.

01:08:02.562 --> 01:08:04.260
What is this for now? Eat

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.305
Why not now?

01:08:06.305 --> 01:08:08.601
Why now, dear?

01:08:08.601 --> 01:08:10.739
No, I have to say now.

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:15.908
I don't know what's good or bad,

01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:18.815
But I am trying to be honest with Aditya.

01:08:18.815 --> 01:08:22.895
Aditya, I had a love like you ...

01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:27.159
But there are some shortcomings.

01:08:27.838 --> 01:08:30.700
Two years ago I fell in love with Ragu.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:36.621
We were made for each other, I thought.

01:08:37.796 --> 01:08:40.765
I also had the opportunity fulfill my dream to go to an American university,

01:08:40.765 --> 01:08:42.683
But I didn't want to go to America without him,

01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:44.231
I didn't let parents know,

01:08:44.231 --> 01:08:46.784
I tore up the University letter.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:52.993
He did not go to the village on his vacation.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.176
I got a job in the US, which started in March.

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:58.558
I know Ragu,

01:08:58.558 --> 01:09:02.508
When I got a chance at an American university,
I was not happy then.

01:09:02.508 --> 01:09:03.847
It's up to you, Jhuma.

01:09:03.847 --> 01:09:06.876
You are rich, I am not rich.

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.884
I have a family that depends on me,
I have to go to America for that.

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.374
Yes.

01:09:11.374 --> 01:09:13.843
You go to America, I'll wait for you.

01:09:13.843 --> 01:09:15.811
- Are you happy now?
- No, Jhuma.

01:09:15.811 --> 01:09:18.057
- I can't go to America.
- Why? Tell me.

01:09:18.057 --> 01:09:21.763
Because if you want to go to America, you have to deposit 20 lakh rupees in the bank.

01:09:21.763 --> 01:09:22.685
Who will pay so much money?

01:09:22.685 --> 01:09:25.615
Why are you saying this? I will give.

01:09:25.615 --> 01:09:28.735
I'll take the money from you! No, I can't, Jhuma.

01:09:28.735 --> 01:09:30.974
You and I are no different,

01:09:30.974 --> 01:09:35.270
Lying to parents, borrowing from people ...

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:36.679
I sent him to America.

01:09:36.679 --> 01:09:39.827
Hello Jhuma, did you not say that Ragu is in America?

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:41.679
Yes, in California.

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.584
No Jhuma, he is cheating on you.

01:09:43.584 --> 01:09:46.783
He lives here in front of our sister's house in Bangalore.

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:48.423
He lives with a woman.

01:09:48.423 --> 01:09:50.331
I couldn't believe what he was saying.

01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:53.492
So all the emails and phone calls that Ragu gave me were lies?

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.036
To find out the truth I went to confront him.

01:09:59.036 --> 01:10:01.029
Baby you go ahead, I'll come later.

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:02.855
- Hey Jhuma!
- Hi, Ragu!

01:10:03.138 --> 01:10:04.003
Where are you

01:10:04.028 --> 01:10:06.845
Just got out of the office, you know how cold it is here?

01:10:07.321 --> 01:10:09.368
Ehh, let's just say I've been here.

01:10:09.635 --> 01:10:11.738
All right, I'll be right back.

01:10:15.301 --> 01:10:16.706
Is this your California?

01:10:16.736 --> 01:10:18.355
- Calm down.
- And, leave this.

01:10:20.192 --> 01:10:22.462
Bad character, are you cheating on me?

01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:31.977
When her mood is bad,
Then I realized how much she was hurt.

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.951
She was deceived.

01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:37.085
After a struggle, she felt better.

01:10:45.414 --> 01:10:48.266
How many times have you seen a doctor? How many times have you prayed?

01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:50.017
Mom, stop.

01:10:50.254 --> 01:10:52.072
All this happened to Aditya.

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:55.864
Now you clearly understand, don't you?

01:10:56.266 --> 01:10:59.717
I understand the past but he understands the future better.

01:11:00.345 --> 01:11:02.938
Jhuma, I have something to tell you.

01:11:02.963 --> 01:11:03.819
That's it ....

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.071
- What happened?
- I hit.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.548
What were you asking him?

01:11:08.573 --> 01:11:10.644
Where can he find such a good girl?

01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:13.740
She is very happy with your work, yes.

01:11:13.765 --> 01:11:14.279
Ah!

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.291
- Say yes
- Yes.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.865
It's been a long time. I feel very relieved.

01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:22.836
She is really happy.

01:11:22.836 --> 01:11:24.408
And swallow you with this joy.

01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:27.210
Ah, you forgot to talk while eating kaza.

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:28.852
Pure milk has been brought for you.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:31.902
That's why I had to stop eating.

01:11:31.902 --> 01:11:33.346
Do we really like to eat kaza?

01:11:34.187 --> 01:11:35.119
Look at this

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:37.280
This is huge.

01:11:38.591 --> 01:11:39.563
I have eaten a lot of kaza.

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:41.578
Hey, why did you stop me?

01:11:41.578 --> 01:11:42.825
Why didn't you let me tell the truth?

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.584
Then they would wash in the street, then people would come to stop.

01:11:47.584 --> 01:11:50.367
If that happened then I would take a fork and kill you.

01:11:50.367 --> 01:11:51.724
Mom, Mom ...

01:11:52.469 --> 01:11:54.175
Where did you find him?

01:11:55.962 --> 01:11:56.541
Yes, I am ...

01:11:56.566 --> 01:11:57.137
Sir.

01:11:57.425 --> 01:11:58.179
If you paid ₹ 1,000 that day,

01:11:58.179 --> 01:12:01.644
Then today you would know why you have to suffer this.

01:12:01.644 --> 01:12:03.652
I mean, it all knows ...

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.711
For this 1000, will our lives be so cluttered?

01:12:05.711 --> 01:12:08.175
That's why we're in this predicament?

01:12:08.175 --> 01:12:10.562
I'm giving you all my money. Tell me all the information about Kiran

01:12:10.562 --> 01:12:11.975
Let me know quickly,

01:12:11.975 --> 01:12:13.999
Kiran? Kiran or Jhuma, what's the difference?

01:12:14.024 --> 01:12:15.053
I will bring success to your love.

01:12:15.053 --> 01:12:16.936
But our necks are stuck,

01:12:18.322 --> 01:12:19.513
- Hey!
- Listen,

01:12:19.799 --> 01:12:21.609
Now I have to tell you what happened to Kiran.

01:12:21.668 --> 01:12:23.960
Either way I'm bringing Kiran, you don't talk,

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.500
Will you

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.592
Hey, he didn't talk to you, he told me

01:12:27.592 --> 01:12:29.040
wait here.

01:12:39.736 --> 01:12:41.721
- I want to tell you something.
- What else do you have to say?

01:12:41.721 --> 01:12:43.406
Aren't you ashamed

01:12:43.406 --> 01:12:46.035
Did you show that letter to everyone?

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:48.501
Kiran, please listen to me.

01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:50.244
I'm not here to hear you.

01:12:50.244 --> 01:12:54.371
Don't tell Jhuma that I am the girl you fell in love with in college.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:55.973
How can I tell Jhuma about this?

01:12:55.973 --> 01:12:57.742
I can't tell Jhuma the truth.

01:12:57.742 --> 01:13:02.072
Haven't you heard his love story?
Please do not return him to his previous position.

01:13:02.072 --> 01:13:04.391
I will tell him when the time comes.

01:13:04.391 --> 01:13:07.084
You don't have to tell him anything, you understand?

01:13:07.084 --> 01:13:09.273
Now I'm talking to you ...

01:13:09.273 --> 01:13:11.558
If you try to tell him,

01:13:11.558 --> 01:13:13.905
You can't see me

01:13:13.905 --> 01:13:15.230
Remember.

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:24.068
What's the situation now?

01:13:24.341 --> 01:13:25.318
See?

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.832
She's still angry with me,

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:31.786
Doesn't that mean she still loves me?

01:13:34.187 --> 01:13:35.171
That's it.

01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:43.626
There is a lot of work, we have to go.

01:13:43.626 --> 01:13:43.994
Goodbye!

01:13:43.994 --> 01:13:45.645
Hey, I forgot to say.

01:13:45.645 --> 01:13:47.078
We are going to Mumbai today.

01:13:47.078 --> 01:13:48.737
Mumbai, for what?

01:13:48.737 --> 01:13:51.918
Kiran has an interview in Mumbai.

01:13:51.918 --> 01:13:55.653
We don't really have a job either,

01:13:55.653 --> 01:13:56.724
Can i come with you

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:59.352
You really want to go?

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:00.615
What happened to her, Jhuma?

01:14:00.615 --> 01:14:04.487
What's the matter? Give this bag here.

01:14:04.487 --> 01:14:06.282
Not now, at noon.

01:14:06.282 --> 01:14:10.269
At noon?  Take the bag.

01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:12.580
Aditya, let's take a selfie.

01:14:14.233 --> 01:14:15.503
Smile a little

01:14:18.681 --> 01:14:22.248
I'm posting it on Facebook,

01:14:26.933 --> 01:14:28.511
See Kiran, how is it?

01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:29.725
Nice..

01:14:30.691 --> 01:14:33.510
I'll just come.

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:35.988
See? How much does she expect from you?

01:14:35.988 --> 01:14:37.215
Don't disappoint her.

01:14:37.215 --> 01:14:40.046
I'm not here for Jhuma, I'm here for you.

01:14:40.046 --> 01:14:43.157
I will do everything until you accept me.

01:14:45.086 --> 01:14:47.494
Kiran, I made a mistake by leaving you.

01:14:47.494 --> 01:14:48.821
Forgive me

01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:51.716
When I came to you,
That's when I see you at the station.

01:14:51.716 --> 01:14:54.494
Stop it, you forget everything and love Jhuma, okay?

01:14:54.494 --> 01:14:57.064
Did you fall in love with me when you saw me?

01:14:57.064 --> 01:15:00.299
I don't love Jhuma, it's a misunderstanding.

01:15:00.299 --> 01:15:01.481
I love you

01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:04.004
Stop it. Just listen to what I say.

01:15:05.048 --> 01:15:07.230
I will not leave you until you accept.

01:15:09.886 --> 01:15:12.119
It's too hot.

01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:10.102
Happy birthday

01:16:10.314 --> 01:16:11.703
To put it bluntly,

01:16:12.074 --> 01:16:14.051
- No one in the house?
- No one.

01:16:14.705 --> 01:16:16.197
Happy birthday

01:16:16.675 --> 01:16:17.969
Let me tell you in advance.

01:16:18.264 --> 01:16:20.677
I could have entered through the door with a calling bell without coming through the window with so much difficulty.

01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:23.055
You gave it to me as a gift on your birthday.

01:16:23.055 --> 01:16:27.543
Give you a present for my birthday
I can handle it without any difficulty.

01:16:31.723 --> 01:16:33.521
- So where are we going?
- You don't have to go anywhere.

01:16:33.521 --> 01:16:36.224
We will stay in this house.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:38.724
Let's have breakfast and talk.

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:40.382
I'll have lunch then talk,

01:16:40.382 --> 01:16:42.237
- Dinner ...
- and talk, right?

01:16:42.237 --> 01:16:42.927
After all, nothing?

01:16:42.927 --> 01:16:46.855
Do nothing but talk.

01:16:46.855 --> 01:16:48.944
If there is more than that, I will kill.

01:16:48.944 --> 01:16:50.586
- Cuddle.
- I'll kill you.

01:16:50.586 --> 01:16:52.003
- Cuddle.
- I'll kill you.

01:16:52.003 --> 01:16:53.420
- Cuddle.
- I'll kill you.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.845
- Cuddle.
- I'll kill you.

01:16:54.845 --> 01:16:57.862
- I'll hug you.
- I'll kill you.

01:16:57.862 --> 01:17:00.378
- Cuddle.
- I'll kill you.

01:17:00.378 --> 01:17:02.588
- I'll kill you.
- I'll hug you.

01:17:02.588 --> 01:17:03.579
I'll kill you.

01:17:10.722 --> 01:17:12.521
What are these?

01:17:16.516 --> 01:17:18.295
I love your sneer,

01:17:19.727 --> 01:17:21.489
I love your smile

01:17:21.489 --> 01:17:23.634
I love your shame.

01:17:31.586 --> 01:17:34.219
I love your pride

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:45.941
Hey! If I talk to Telugu people in Telugu,

01:17:45.941 --> 01:17:49.179
Then they will hide many of them from us,

01:17:49.179 --> 01:17:51.697
I don't enjoy listening,

01:17:51.697 --> 01:17:55.519
And the journey will be dust, moreover they will be silent, I will also be silent.

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:04.341
Hey, some Telugu is coming I'm going to handle them,
I'll call you later, goodbye.

01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:06.062
Hi! Are you Jhuma?

01:18:06.062 --> 01:18:08.706
- I'm Jhuma,
- Come on, come on, madam.

01:18:13.327 --> 01:18:15.340
- Name?
- Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.637
- What?
- Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

01:18:17.637 --> 01:18:19.048
Anything else left?

01:18:20.604 --> 01:18:22.254
I do not understand Telugu.

01:18:22.254 --> 01:18:27.016
Oh, then he doesn't understand what we're talking about in front of him.

01:18:27.016 --> 01:18:36.265
- You say you don't know Telugu?
- This song is from Sir Hindi Blockbuster.

01:18:36.265 --> 01:18:38.159
- Ah
- Hindi

01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:40.247
- I forgot all the blockbusters in Hindi movies.
- Yes.

01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:42.706
- Play a song.
- I'm doing.

01:18:46.196 --> 01:18:46.318
Telugu song?

01:18:47.047 --> 01:18:49.413
You don't know! So what are these?

01:18:49.413 --> 01:18:52.956
Here is a South song, all the rest is Hindi.

01:18:52.956 --> 01:18:54.651
Do you understand what i said

01:18:55.707 --> 01:18:58.190
Joke. don't panick.

01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:00.170
I'm very hungry. I can't handle it anymore.

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:01.359
All right, madam.

01:19:01.359 --> 01:19:03.490
Do you understand

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:05.532
Madame wants to see a movie ... a movie ... a movie.

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:06.343
Hey!

01:19:06.343 --> 01:19:09.664
- For this meal, food, restaurant.
-Ah, food!

01:19:09.664 --> 01:19:11.582
Food, food, food.

01:19:11.582 --> 01:19:14.508
- It's very difficult to stay with it.
- Me too.

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:17.338
- Bhansali?
- Sir,

01:19:17.338 --> 01:19:19.184
- Did you say anything?
- No, sir.

01:19:19.184 --> 01:19:21.602
- Come on
- Going, going.

01:19:22.259 --> 01:19:23.821
The bull.

01:19:23.821 --> 01:19:26.109
Nice to meet you, my name is Bhansali.

01:19:27.989 --> 01:19:29.075
Bring the juice.

01:19:29.075 --> 01:19:30.714
- For me too
- What juice?

01:19:30.714 --> 01:19:32.372
I like pineapple very much.

01:19:32.997 --> 01:19:35.113
Two pineapple juices.

01:19:35.113 --> 01:19:38.332
Bring a mango juice, not pineapple.

01:19:38.332 --> 01:19:39.323
Ok ma'am.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:45.525
Thank you.
Welcome  ir.

01:19:50.006 --> 01:19:51.375
The juice is very good.

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:55.255
Such juices are also available in our juice shops.

01:19:55.255 --> 01:19:58.341
Yes, I forgot, were you intoxicated?

01:20:01.826 --> 01:20:03.798
You study at KGP College, don't you?

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:07.166
Hey, Kiran was in the same college, right?

01:20:07.166 --> 01:20:09.417
Did the two of you meet before?

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.850
That's why I thought I saw it somewhere.

01:20:14.468 --> 01:20:15.963
I never saw you

01:20:17.211 --> 01:20:18.709
Didn't see.

01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.431
What is his name?

01:20:24.665 --> 01:20:28.520
You just say his name, he can't be left like that.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.569
In fact, someone in your college has squandered her life.

01:20:31.569 --> 01:20:34.086
I don't know what he did,

01:20:34.086 --> 01:20:36.297
Kiran's life was disturbed because of him.

01:20:36.297 --> 01:20:39.843
You know she was so sweet and happy?

01:20:40.685 --> 01:20:42.571
Who hurt Kiran?

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.751
Idiot, rogue, rascal.

01:20:44.751 --> 01:20:45.959
Why is he overdoing it?

01:20:45.959 --> 01:20:47.928
Can you name him?

01:20:47.928 --> 01:20:50.488
Aditya must know him.

01:20:50.488 --> 01:20:54.104
Don't leave her, name him ...
Don't take him so lightly.

01:20:56.055 --> 01:20:58.566
No, he will suffer the consequences.

01:20:58.566 --> 01:20:59.611
What happened?

01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:01.863
Do you still love him?

01:21:01.863 --> 01:21:03.952
- You still love him??
-  Is that why you can't say the name?

01:21:03.952 --> 01:21:06.045
- Can you tell?
- Can you tell?

01:21:06.045 --> 01:21:07.859
Jhuma please don't irritate me.

01:21:07.859 --> 01:21:09.677
Forget about him.

01:21:10.368 --> 01:21:15.236
I'm very angry, I would have killed him if I had found him.

01:21:17.697 --> 01:21:20.265
I said time will tell him, but you told him everything?

01:21:20.768 --> 01:21:23.325
- Why did you leave clues?
- What would I say then?

01:21:23.325 --> 01:21:25.272
Why did you talk about KGP College?

01:21:25.689 --> 01:21:27.977
I have already told him that I am studying in KGP College.

01:21:27.977 --> 01:21:31.144
Now if I tell him it's another college he'll suspect me.

01:21:31.144 --> 01:21:32.985
What is the world coming to?

01:21:33.294 --> 01:21:35.421
- Take the call.
- No need.

01:21:37.603 --> 01:21:39.992
What do you see there he does not understand Telugu. Right?

01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:46.044
I ate a lot.

01:21:46.044 --> 01:21:47.746
He is talking about food.

01:21:47.746 --> 01:21:49.095
Hey!

01:21:49.689 --> 01:21:51.554
- Jhuma is here,
- Come on, everyone.

01:21:51.554 --> 01:21:52.259
Bill?

01:21:52.259 --> 01:21:54.115
- I paid.
- Did you pay? Come on.

01:21:59.741 --> 01:22:01.902
- Come on.
- You go.

01:22:05.452 --> 01:22:06.703
- Bhansali??
- Sir.

01:22:06.703 --> 01:22:08.545
- Did you say anything?
- No, sir.

01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:10.295
- Can we go?
- Come on.

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:12.204
Son of a gun.

01:22:12.787 --> 01:22:14.327
Zia Gawar, come on.

01:22:15.502 --> 01:22:18.302
Don't worry, you will be nominated.

01:22:18.302 --> 01:22:20.659
You know how much I need the job.

01:22:20.659 --> 01:22:22.638
Must be nominated anyway.

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:24.311
Calm down, calm down.

01:22:24.311 --> 01:22:25.918
Kiran, you don't need this job.

01:22:25.918 --> 01:22:26.684
- What?
- What?

01:22:26.684 --> 01:22:30.300
However, if you do not go to the vegetable market and buy vegetables, the shopkeeper will talk less.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.077
That's it.

01:22:31.077 --> 01:22:33.364
This job is less than you deserve.

01:22:33.364 --> 01:22:35.432
You have the time and the opportunity.

01:22:35.432 --> 01:22:37.899
That's why I was saying on the street that ...

01:22:37.899 --> 01:22:39.987
Let's go see the movie.

01:22:39.987 --> 01:22:44.807
If you like them, they like the question
And if they like you too,

01:22:44.807 --> 01:22:47.398
Then you will say yes.

01:22:47.398 --> 01:22:50.540
If other companies are late in answering.

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.731
This opportunity will give this company.

01:22:53.834 --> 01:22:57.029
If it matches the feedback you need.

01:22:57.029 --> 01:22:59.639
That way you will be ready for an interview.

01:22:59.639 --> 01:23:01.008
- wow.

01:23:03.589 --> 01:23:04.223
- Please come,

01:23:07.021 --> 01:23:08.719
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:23:19.074 --> 01:23:20.121
What happened?

01:23:21.781 --> 01:23:24.726
I said yes.

01:23:25.365 --> 01:23:26.500
Congratulations.

01:23:28.102 --> 01:23:30.468
Brother, take out the bags.

01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:33.470
Won't you thank Aditya?

01:23:33.837 --> 01:23:38.554
Thank you Aditya. You gave me the confidence to handle it.

01:23:38.554 --> 01:23:42.010
I gave a motiviational speech like an American

01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:43.999
and I get a cheap thank you?

01:23:43.999 --> 01:23:45.026
So what do you want

01:23:45.026 --> 01:23:46.519
I want a party.

01:23:46.519 --> 01:23:49.329
I'll stay here for the night and have fun.

01:23:49.329 --> 01:23:50.802
Ok, fine.

01:23:50.802 --> 01:23:53.130
Great, very good.

01:23:55.433 --> 01:23:57.203
- Party!
- Party!

01:26:53.036 --> 01:26:54.520
- Sir?
- Eh?

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.141
Sir my room?

01:26:55.141 --> 01:26:57.699
How do I tell him that?

01:26:57.699 --> 01:26:59.591
You and I are locked in the same room.

01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:02.804
In the same room?

01:27:08.736 --> 01:27:10.106
I am very happy today.

01:27:10.106 --> 01:27:11.833
Because you have two women to enjoy.

01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:12.952
- Bhansali??
- Sir!

01:27:12.952 --> 01:27:14.210
- Did you say anything?
- No.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:16.867
Sir.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.058
Sir.

01:27:20.058 --> 01:27:22.906
What are you doing, sir? I don't swing that way sir.

01:27:22.906 --> 01:27:24.640
Good night, Bhansali.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.780
Good night?

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.056
How can I sleep without knowing what is happening here?

01:27:28.056 --> 01:27:30.228
My Hindi, your Telugu, I ...

01:27:36.597 --> 01:27:38.570
Inside this room ...

01:27:43.883 --> 01:27:45.010
Hi!

01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:48.947
By mistake, the room has changed.

01:27:49.135 --> 01:27:51.325
- No problem, good night!
- Good night, madam.

01:27:53.403 --> 01:27:55.050
That means the girl has been inside for so long,

01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:56.813
Now the two of them are together,

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.259
And the devil alone,

01:27:58.259 --> 01:28:00.223
Oh my.

01:28:00.944 --> 01:28:01.856
Hello!

01:28:06.652 --> 01:28:09.819
This girl was inside, that girl was outside ..

01:28:09.819 --> 01:28:12.471
Now that girl is inside, this girl is outside ...

01:28:12.471 --> 01:28:15.643
But whoever was inside was with him.

01:28:15.643 --> 01:28:18.792
If I go back, I will know.

01:28:18.792 --> 01:28:21.464
What's going on inside ...

01:28:22.248 --> 01:28:24.702
I have to go back now.

01:28:28.297 --> 01:28:30.279
All right, the girl is here ...

01:28:30.986 --> 01:28:33.170
Then there's the TV ....

01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.459
Where is he?

01:28:35.459 --> 01:28:37.489
I'm always behind you

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:41.234
Where are you

01:28:44.314 --> 01:28:45.930
It sounded like a coconut falling.

01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:50.264
Brother, I don't know how to swim,
Lift me up

01:28:51.265 --> 01:28:53.220
I don't know how to swim,

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:54.790
- Bhansali??
- Sir!

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:56.491
- Did you say anything?
- No.

01:28:56.491 --> 01:28:58.892
You ... you don't know Telugu ... don't you know?

01:29:03.239 --> 01:29:04.702
I don't know much, boss.

01:29:04.702 --> 01:29:06.619
What's going on here

01:29:06.619 --> 01:29:08.915
I came here knowing this.

01:29:08.915 --> 01:29:10.438
I've been waiting since morning,

01:29:10.438 --> 01:29:13.833
Your love story is like a Chinese movie,
Where there are no subtitles.

01:29:13.833 --> 01:29:15.502
Sir, I don't understand a thing,

01:29:15.502 --> 01:29:18.026
- Now you want to hear my love story?
- Please ...

01:29:18.026 --> 01:29:20.119
- Follow me.
- All right.

01:30:15.465 --> 01:30:17.954
Your statements are painful.

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:20.086
Where is the love?

01:30:20.086 --> 01:30:22.495
Love is not a taste.

01:30:24.235 --> 01:30:25.652
Chutney,

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:30.431
Hey!

01:30:30.945 --> 01:30:33.452
- Where did they go?
- I don't know Telugu.

01:30:33.452 --> 01:30:34.764
Ah, you don't know Telugu?

01:30:35.817 --> 01:30:39.354
- Sorry I forgot.
- Have you seen them?

01:30:39.354 --> 01:30:42.068
Did you give Dhuka before or are you giving now? #

01:30:42.068 --> 01:30:43.689
You have no sense.

01:30:58.406 --> 01:31:01.190
So from there two you take four.

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.612
What's happening over there?

01:31:18.171 --> 01:31:19.683
Why are you hanging out here?

01:31:19.916 --> 01:31:21.468
Go to the classroom and wait for me.

01:31:58.762 --> 01:32:01.909
Aditya ... Aditya ... this!

01:32:01.909 --> 01:32:06.900
There is a temple there, we will stay there for 2 minutes.

01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:21.234
I'll get something for you.

01:32:25.524 --> 01:32:27.308
Sari always makes you look very beautiful.

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:31.801
This sari is not for me? I know

01:32:32.661 --> 01:32:35.279
My marriage is fixed.

01:32:35.279 --> 01:32:37.085
He is now in Mumbai,

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:39.453
That's why I looked for a job here.

01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:43.871
Anyway, thanks, I got the job due to you.

01:32:45.314 --> 01:32:46.560
Let's go guys.

01:32:47.373 --> 01:32:48.694
Does anyone want to eat it?

01:32:48.694 --> 01:32:51.987
Yes or no? Well, let's go.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.901
She's lying to me that her marriage is fixed.

01:33:05.901 --> 01:33:07.804
How could he remain silent for so long?

01:33:08.605 --> 01:33:10.233
Why is this happening?

01:33:10.817 --> 01:33:12.708
I'm going crazy thinking.

01:33:12.708 --> 01:33:15.021
Yes, I can see.

01:33:17.945 --> 01:33:25.187
Hello!

01:33:39.122 --> 01:33:40.594
Who is this?

01:33:42.841 --> 01:33:43.877
Hey!

01:33:44.421 --> 01:33:45.700
You guys.

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.948
Yes boss, you recognized us.

01:33:47.948 --> 01:33:51.596
Boss, we've learned the dialogues, how are you?

01:33:51.596 --> 01:33:54.639
Apardath gives all the calls, but will not call.

01:33:58.124 --> 01:33:59.963
Didn't I say? Call again ...

01:33:59.963 --> 01:34:03.759
Sir, sir, I, what happened? It's me.

01:34:03.759 --> 01:34:04.975
Oh you

01:34:04.975 --> 01:34:05.466
Ok, tell me.

01:34:05.466 --> 01:34:08.492
Sir, now that I have left Madame Kiran,
She is at the station now.

01:34:09.312 --> 01:34:12.442
- Now you see,
- Well, you'll get your 5,000.

01:34:12.442 --> 01:34:14.732
Come on, come on.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.979
He is leaving without telling me.

01:34:16.797 --> 01:34:20.067
- You go.
- All right, all right.

01:35:50.888 --> 01:35:52.127
Please sir, the train will depart.

01:35:52.127 --> 01:35:55.614
There are more trains here, why are you in such a hurry?
Come on, sit down.

01:36:06.119 --> 01:36:09.701
Aditya, Aditya!

01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:13.130
Aditya ...

01:36:22.478 --> 01:36:26.017
You're sitting here and I'm looking for you all over the station.
Get on the train.

01:36:31.359 --> 01:36:34.343
That's why I say, why would you call my name?
Thanks Grandpa.

01:36:34.343 --> 01:36:36.538
If you didn't do that, she probably wouldn't talk.

01:36:36.538 --> 01:36:39.388
Are you Krishna? Who will take him?

01:36:39.388 --> 01:36:42.233
I don't usually fight with people here,

01:36:42.233 --> 01:36:44.975
but I'll make a exception for you guys.

01:36:44.975 --> 01:36:47.454
What?
- Hey, you stay,

01:36:50.919 --> 01:36:53.421
Beat? Come on ...

01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:54.350
Stupid boy

01:37:01.194 --> 01:37:03.160
Who else wants to get hit?

01:37:04.508 --> 01:37:05.633
Grab this bag.

01:37:08.994 --> 01:37:11.480
What's going on The clothes in the bag will fall off.
Hold on well.

01:37:17.241 --> 01:37:19.537
Chinna, give Madam a hot cup of tea.

01:37:19.537 --> 01:37:20.715
All right, sir.

01:37:30.501 --> 01:37:31.819
You drink tea slowly.

01:37:31.819 --> 01:37:33.382
It'll take some time.

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:57.502
We made a mistake sir, forgive us.

01:37:58.175 --> 01:38:00.930
Hit him sir, sorry uncle.

01:38:03.242 --> 01:38:07.470
What is this? I thought we were friends. Who does this?

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.418
Who did I hand the bag to?

01:38:22.265 --> 01:38:23.308
Who?

01:38:28.226 --> 01:38:29.205
Hey.

01:38:29.781 --> 01:38:31.868
Come here, come here.

01:38:33.266 --> 01:38:35.572
- Ah, where are you going?
- Sir, going home with family.

01:38:35.572 --> 01:38:37.209
Going with my bag to your house?

01:38:37.209 --> 01:38:38.514
Sir, sir the train is leaving.

01:38:38.514 --> 01:38:41.157
- The train is leaving, so what?
- Sir, that girl is leaving on the train.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:45.338
You couldn't say that sooner?

01:38:52.631 --> 01:38:53.585
Oops!

01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:08.346
This monster,

01:39:08.346 --> 01:39:11.053
I don't mean you, phone.

01:39:11.053 --> 01:39:13.246
I never thought you were so selfish.

01:39:14.428 --> 01:39:17.079
Hi, my name is Sashi, what's your name?

01:39:17.079 --> 01:39:18.703
What do you want? What do you want?

01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:20.941
He says on the phone, you say.

01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:23.999
I know your name will be as beautiful as you look.

01:39:24.954 --> 01:39:27.277
I think your day is bad today.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.226
Tell me, won't you?

01:39:32.881 --> 01:39:34.270
My name is Kiran.

01:39:35.562 --> 01:39:37.692
Great name, a beautiful name.

01:39:37.692 --> 01:39:40.665
Hearing your name sounds like a song to me.

01:39:48.484 --> 01:39:49.715
Very good.

01:39:50.565 --> 01:39:52.178
Hey!

01:39:52.484 --> 01:39:54.708
Listen to the phone, then talk.

01:39:54.708 --> 01:39:56.427
Do whatever you want.

01:39:57.062 --> 01:40:00.053
I turned around a lot.

01:40:00.053 --> 01:40:04.743
I even got into fights with thugs but got no response,

01:40:04.743 --> 01:40:08.143
When you sing and talk, and you think it's set?

01:40:08.143 --> 01:40:10.535
Has anyone asked your name?

01:40:11.677 --> 01:40:15.267
Auntie,  there may be some violence would you mind shifting seats?

01:40:15.267 --> 01:40:16.520
No, I'm fine son.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.566
You are very helpful, I like it.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.816
I feel like a song when I'm beating you.

01:40:26.816 --> 01:40:28.152
What song?

01:40:36.052 --> 01:40:37.613
Finish the song.

01:40:39.927 --> 01:40:42.625
- Give me a ticket?
- Tickets?

01:40:45.904 --> 01:40:47.158
This is my ticket.

01:40:47.158 --> 01:40:49.178
- Sit in my seat, okay?
- All right.

01:40:49.178 --> 01:40:52.935
Go sit there.

01:40:52.935 --> 01:40:55.270
Sir, is this a platform ticket?

01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:58.019
- I remember another song.
- I'm leaving, sir.

01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:18.051
What are you doing aunty, playing candy crush?

01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:11.982
- Kiran?
- Hmm.

01:41:11.982 --> 01:41:13.550
Ah, Candy Crush? Sorry aunt

01:41:15.691 --> 01:41:16.838
Kiran.

01:41:16.838 --> 01:41:19.467
Get up. Our village has arrived.

01:41:20.913 --> 01:41:22.065
Come on.

01:41:28.468 --> 01:41:29.827
Sent car? Or take a taxi?

01:41:29.827 --> 01:41:31.531
Do you consider yourself my husband?

01:41:31.531 --> 01:41:34.250
Give me the bag, aren't you ashamed?

01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:36.001
Why are you still following me?

01:41:36.835 --> 01:41:39.388
I thought it was my luck that you came into my life,
But look ...

01:41:39.388 --> 01:41:40.943
That was wrong.

01:41:41.761 --> 01:41:43.495
I lost when you came I was blocked for love.

01:41:43.495 --> 01:41:48.136
You showed me a world of love.

01:41:48.136 --> 01:41:51.995
I said, I want nothing more than you.

01:41:51.995 --> 01:41:55.944
But when you leave me, you don't want me anymore.

01:41:55.944 --> 01:41:58.301
Do you know why I was looking for you then?

01:42:04.295 --> 01:42:05.451
What happened?

01:42:05.451 --> 01:42:08.063
Someone hit him with a car.

01:42:08.063 --> 01:42:10.165
Now he has been taken to hospital.

01:42:12.765 --> 01:42:14.127
Where is room number eight'?

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:15.615
Madam, that way.

01:42:18.582 --> 01:42:20.529
Car, car? Look what happened now.

01:42:20.529 --> 01:42:21.737
Look what happened now.

01:42:21.737 --> 01:42:25.633
What would happen if the car? Baby, that's fine, that's a lot.

01:42:25.633 --> 01:42:26.901
Yes, that's it ....

01:42:33.603 --> 01:42:36.643
Do you know how your son got into this accident?

01:42:37.159 --> 01:42:38.410
Lost love

01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:43.054
She's not your girlfriend, just a friend.

01:42:43.054 --> 01:42:45.774
Besides, everyone is here,

01:42:45.774 --> 01:42:47.674
What happened to her?

01:42:47.674 --> 01:42:49.146
It's not his fault,

01:42:49.146 --> 01:42:50.627
And he's sad.

01:42:50.627 --> 01:42:56.411
I didn't tell him.

01:42:56.411 --> 01:43:00.202
Then I realized that I had misunderstood Kasi.

01:43:03.031 --> 01:43:05.070
I came to the college to apologize.

01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:09.859
But you didn't let me tell you.

01:43:09.859 --> 01:43:12.065
Don't worry, I'm not here to apologize.

01:43:12.065 --> 01:43:13.918
Goodbye forever.

01:43:13.918 --> 01:43:16.056
What else is there in my life?

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:19.533
I saw that day if you could break my heart,

01:43:19.533 --> 01:43:22.941
When I hit my arm, I thought he might hit me too.

01:43:22.941 --> 01:43:25.035
I've decided I don't want you anymore.

01:43:25.035 --> 01:43:29.559
I'm going away, you're going away too
Then you will not be able to see or hear.

01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:31.812
Goodbye.

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:35.452
I forgot what I came to say.

01:43:35.452 --> 01:43:36.353
Too bad.

01:43:36.353 --> 01:43:40.291
I was so sad that he left me without turning around.

01:43:43.352 --> 01:43:46.703
You're gone, but where am I going?

01:43:46.703 --> 01:43:48.886
I studied here for two years.

01:43:48.886 --> 01:43:50.106
Are you back now?

01:43:50.106 --> 01:43:51.860
And you say love again?

01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:54.656
Do you want to kill me now?

01:43:55.347 --> 01:43:57.318
Why do you come and go as you please?

01:43:57.318 --> 01:43:58.685
Do I have any rights?

01:43:58.685 --> 01:43:59.714
I'm sorry, Kiran.

01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:02.419
I hurt you a lot.

01:44:03.656 --> 01:44:05.648
Wondering if I could forget you.

01:44:05.648 --> 01:44:08.291
But now I realize how big of a mistake I have made.

01:44:08.291 --> 01:44:10.170
Forgive me this time.

01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:11.826
I really love you

01:44:11.826 --> 01:44:13.930
I hate you Go to hell

01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:17.165
When you tell me to hate, it sounds like love to me.

01:44:17.165 --> 01:44:20.216
Do you know why? Because I still love you.

01:44:21.723 --> 01:44:23.813
I love you more than you love me

01:44:23.813 --> 01:44:25.983
And the tears in your eyes?

01:44:27.916 --> 01:44:30.891
You can hide your anger from anyone,

01:44:30.891 --> 01:44:32.567
But can't love,

01:44:32.567 --> 01:44:34.525
Because it can be felt.

01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:39.511
Just give me a chance,
I will erase all the past.

01:44:40.389 --> 01:44:43.205
Let's start our love anew, let's go.

01:44:46.576 --> 01:44:47.857
Hi, Hemant.

01:44:58.512 --> 01:44:59.577
What are you doing here

01:44:59.577 --> 01:45:01.736
I left a little early, because I had no patience until my wedding day.

01:45:03.346 --> 01:45:06.209
Aditya, this is Hemant, my fiance.

01:45:06.209 --> 01:45:06.850
Hello!

01:45:08.659 --> 01:45:11.403
Hemant, he is Aditya,
Jhuma's future husband.

01:45:11.403 --> 01:45:13.767
Ah, you are Aditya! We've become brothers.

01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.740
Jhuma Yekina offered me this,

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:20.841
But I like Kiran now.

01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:22.599
And you like Jhuma.

01:45:22.599 --> 01:45:24.160
Were you two on the same train?

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:26.350
Yes, in an accident.

01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:28.298
Ah, very good, you stay, see you later.

01:45:29.407 --> 01:45:30.408
- I got in the car.
- All right.

01:45:30.408 --> 01:45:31.348
See you later.

01:45:32.945 --> 01:45:36.096
There are two more days to change the ring,
We got married a month later.

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:38.656
So, love again is impossible.

01:45:38.656 --> 01:45:41.247
Do you understand what you are doing

01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:45.331
You can fool yourself, not me.

01:45:45.331 --> 01:45:46.785
I can't be stupid

01:45:46.785 --> 01:45:49.694
Will you betray yourself and lie?

01:45:51.130 --> 01:45:54.304
Who are you doing this for?

01:45:54.304 --> 01:45:56.070
If you accept him,

01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:58.369
Your life, my life, everyone's life will be destroyed.

01:45:59.716 --> 01:46:01.477
If you're angry, kill me.

01:46:03.773 --> 01:46:05.307
But accept my love.

01:46:07.738 --> 01:46:09.386
I love you, whether you like it or not.

01:46:09.386 --> 01:46:12.958
I still love you today

01:46:13.573 --> 01:46:17.785
Will always love

01:50:18.776 --> 01:50:19.552
Yes, say,

01:50:19.552 --> 01:50:21.725
Jhuma and Jhuma's parents are here,

01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:23.638
Feel free to visit your family,

01:50:24.083 --> 01:50:25.377
Why?

01:50:25.377 --> 01:50:26.277
Talk about marriage.

01:50:26.277 --> 01:50:28.875
When you bring her up, do you think I'm going to get married?

01:50:32.274 --> 01:50:36.190
Not just Jhuma here, I won't do it to anyone, even if I die.

01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:38.587
Tell him the truth now,

01:50:38.587 --> 01:50:40.618
Or should I say?

01:50:50.614 --> 01:50:52.103
Why did you come here?

01:50:54.146 --> 01:50:55.625
Jhuma!

01:50:55.625 --> 01:50:58.899
Jhuma, I just told my love story,
Didn't tell the truth,

01:50:58.899 --> 01:51:01.367
The girl I fell in love with is nobody else ...

01:51:05.519 --> 01:51:06.838
Simply put,

01:51:08.623 --> 01:51:10.281
I still love Kiran.

01:51:12.236 --> 01:51:14.418
So what happened to me so far?

01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:15.703
I was trying to say,

01:51:17.095 --> 01:51:18.528
You didn't ask,

01:51:18.528 --> 01:51:21.017
You were happy to forget your past,

01:51:21.017 --> 01:51:23.327
I thought you would be sad to hear that.

01:51:23.327 --> 01:51:26.465
Have you thought for a moment about what you are saying?

01:51:28.096 --> 01:51:30.497
I have come to Mumbai for you.

01:51:30.497 --> 01:51:32.350
I thought he came for me.

01:51:33.668 --> 01:51:35.492
But you two used me.

01:51:35.492 --> 01:51:38.032
You are sitting behind me telling a love story?

01:51:38.545 --> 01:51:40.084
Love story? Do you understand

01:51:41.397 --> 01:51:43.205
A love is when two people love each other.

01:51:43.205 --> 01:51:44.518
It's not called love, if one loves,

01:51:44.518 --> 01:51:46.263
She loves me too.

01:51:46.263 --> 01:51:47.121
Thanks.

01:51:47.121 --> 01:51:53.025
I thought you would leave when you heard about my marriage.

01:51:55.384 --> 01:51:56.151
When you're married and I'll let you go ...

01:51:56.151 --> 01:52:00.215
You said you were always happy with your boyfriend,
And now you are giving him?

01:52:01.325 --> 01:52:02.967
How cheap did you think I was?

01:52:02.967 --> 01:52:04.213
Are you happy now

01:52:04.213 --> 01:52:06.676
What else do you want?

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:11.348
It's easy for you to love girls and it's easy to give up.

01:52:11.348 --> 01:52:13.728
See how much we are suffering because of you.

01:52:13.728 --> 01:52:14.861
Are you suffering alone?

01:52:15.987 --> 01:52:18.092
I was just in love.

01:52:18.092 --> 01:52:20.036
Don't you know how much I've suffered for you?

01:52:20.036 --> 01:52:23.135
I thought you would come back and love me.

01:52:24.789 --> 01:52:27.066
I was able to understand that there is no love in your mind.
I'm going too far.

01:52:27.066 --> 01:52:28.667
I have love there too.

01:52:28.667 --> 01:52:31.150
If you still think I'm following you,

01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:32.686
I have love there too.

01:52:35.941 --> 01:52:37.597
I was wrong to leave you,

01:52:37.597 --> 01:52:39.231
But you know it's not wrong.

01:52:40.204 --> 01:52:43.926
Luckily, I made a mistake before, but now I have another mistake,

01:52:44.659 --> 01:52:46.882
It is also wrong to try those who make mistakes first.

01:52:46.882 --> 01:52:48.133
It's been a long time.

01:52:48.133 --> 01:52:49.957
A lot

01:52:49.957 --> 01:52:53.393
I apologize for my mistake, Jhuma.

01:52:53.393 --> 01:52:55.606
I'm sorry, if you can forgive me.

01:52:56.637 --> 01:52:59.453
I made a mistake, but I did not deceive anyone.

01:53:01.797 --> 01:53:03.621
I did this to let you know how much I love you.

01:53:03.621 --> 01:53:05.921
She wants to get away from me.

01:53:05.921 --> 01:53:06.787
I'm really sorry.

01:53:06.787 --> 01:53:12.159
You can punish me, I'll take it head on.

01:53:13.265 --> 01:53:16.856
I'm leaving, goodbye.
I will never return to your life.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.841
What are you waiting for go get married.

01:53:23.199 --> 01:53:25.968
Get lost.

01:53:37.956 --> 01:53:42.153
Although you are asked to do so,

01:53:42.312 --> 01:53:47.958
Where is your identity

01:53:48.273 --> 01:53:52.614
You are my life ...!

01:53:52.842 --> 01:53:54.033
Life ...!

01:53:55.190 --> 01:54:00.657
Like two shadows in a single path,

01:54:00.682 --> 01:54:06.171
Will your memories not last with me ...!

01:54:06.287 --> 01:54:11.259
Don't forget my soul ...!

01:54:11.284 --> 01:54:12.360
My soul ...!

01:54:19.544 --> 01:54:21.404
What if?

01:54:22.006 --> 01:54:29.377
Not really that way, but

01:54:29.628 --> 01:54:33.755
I'll live in your dreams ...!

01:54:35.332 --> 01:54:37.046
Make a living ...!

01:54:37.094 --> 01:54:41.216
Without reason, don't hold my breath ...!

01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:46.873
Don't try to hide my love ...!

01:54:46.979 --> 01:54:53.474
Are you angry with me

01:54:53.499 --> 01:54:55.727
Make a living ...!

01:55:02.487 --> 01:55:05.011
Make a living ...!

01:55:04.923 --> 01:55:05.764
Kiran.

01:55:06.246 --> 01:55:08.394
Sorry aunty
I want to talk to you, come on.

01:55:14.996 --> 01:55:17.854
I forgave Aditya,
You can't?

01:55:17.854 --> 01:55:20.313
Don't talk about it.

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:22.844
Well, okay forget that to him.

01:55:22.844 --> 01:55:25.974
Are you happy with this marriage?

01:55:25.974 --> 01:55:28.028
Think for a moment.

01:55:28.028 --> 01:55:32.030
What you did that day, you are still doing today.

01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:35.012
He did not give me this letter.

01:55:35.012 --> 01:55:36.500
He wrote it for you.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:40.047
Excluding these, read it and then do whatever you want.

01:55:53.887 --> 01:55:56.416
- What are you doing here? It's time.
- coming.

01:56:29.858 --> 01:56:32.767
The day I saw you,
That day I was born again.

01:56:37.365 --> 01:56:40.093
Because from then on, I started to think,

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:48.830
There was nothing special in my life before you came.

01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:51.992
Ever since you came, every moment of my day has seemed fascinating.

01:56:52.499 --> 01:56:58.042
But now I want to walk holding your hand.

01:57:01.555 --> 01:57:06.502
Every day I will try to keep you happy from every moment to the last.

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:09.482
I will give you strength from behind,

01:57:10.668 --> 01:57:13.642
I will carry you from the front and take you through the problem.

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.142
I will take care of you like my mother,

01:57:17.142 --> 01:57:19.870
I don't know how much you have to win in life to get it,

01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:22.453
But I can go any distance for you.

01:57:22.453 --> 01:57:24.149
I will cross any sea,

01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:26.082
I can climb any sky,

01:57:26.082 --> 01:57:28.382
Because you are my life.

01:57:28.382 --> 01:57:30.546
I can't imagine a moment without you.

01:57:30.546 --> 01:57:33.580
You are my life, and this life is in my hands now.

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.328
Do what your adults think is best.

01:57:35.328 --> 01:57:37.254
Yours, Aditya.

01:57:47.693 --> 01:57:48.661
Why are you calling here?

01:57:50.092 --> 01:57:51.370
Listen, Hemant,

01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:53.425
Today's my marriage with Kiran

01:57:57.099 --> 01:57:58.196
You say ...

01:57:59.316 --> 01:58:01.762
I can't marry you, Hemant.

01:58:01.762 --> 01:58:03.182
I'm very sorry

01:58:05.285 --> 01:58:07.390
It was good joke, get ready, go.

01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:09.042
It's not a joke Hemant.

01:58:09.042 --> 01:58:10.547
Really ...

01:58:10.996 --> 01:58:13.081
I love Aditya.

01:58:13.081 --> 01:58:15.549
I can't marry anyone else.

01:58:15.549 --> 01:58:17.412
Hey ... Aditya?

01:58:17.412 --> 01:58:20.089
You want to trust him,

01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:21.945
How do you trust her when she says it's her boyfriend?

01:58:21.945 --> 01:58:23.370
Let's go.

01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:25.158
Trust me for a moment.

01:58:25.158 --> 01:58:28.829
But you don't have that much time,
Will you believe me soon, please?

01:58:28.829 --> 01:58:30.923
You don't love your boyfriend

01:58:30.923 --> 01:58:34.318
No Himant, I really loved her boyfriend.

01:58:34.318 --> 01:58:36.883
They have loved each other for 4 years.

01:58:36.883 --> 01:58:38.351
You already know everything?

01:58:38.351 --> 01:58:49.852
No, I knew that a little while ago.

01:58:44.419 --> 01:58:45.826
I do not understand anything.

01:58:47.087 --> 01:58:50.473
What's going on How did it go so far?

01:58:52.515 --> 01:58:53.951
Because ...

01:58:57.214 --> 01:59:01.558
It happened.

01:59:05.356 --> 01:59:07.682
Sir, the priest is calling.

01:59:09.201 --> 01:59:12.666
Who told you to call the priest? Go

01:59:14.725 --> 01:59:16.386
He agreed,
- Okay?

01:59:16.386 --> 01:59:17.587
Well, Himant

01:59:21.486 --> 01:59:23.001
- Himant
- Hmm.

01:59:23.001 --> 01:59:25.293
He needs to get out of here quickly,

01:59:25.293 --> 01:59:27.267
It would be nice if someone could go with him.

01:59:27.267 --> 01:59:28.878
Would you drop her off?

01:59:36.658 --> 01:59:37.830
Let's hurry.

01:59:38.936 --> 01:59:40.627
Go left.

01:59:40.627 --> 01:59:43.660
Today is Eid, tell me where to go?

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:44.882
At Aditya's house,

01:59:48.027 --> 01:59:49.892
What makes you so good, Hemant?

01:59:49.892 --> 01:59:52.551
You know that your future wife loves someone,

01:59:52.551 --> 01:59:55.399
Yet you are making them one, very good.

01:59:56.333 --> 01:59:59.186
You have lost Aditya by your side.

01:59:59.186 --> 02:00:01.708
Be quiet, I can't hear anything.

02:00:01.708 --> 02:00:03.566
- All right.
- Please be quiet.

02:00:03.566 --> 02:00:04.508
- Hello!
- Hello!

02:00:04.508 --> 02:00:06.511
Kasi, I am Kiran

02:00:06.511 --> 02:00:08.847
Where is Aditya? I can't communicate with him.

02:00:08.847 --> 02:00:10.174
Are you calling Aditya?

02:00:10.174 --> 02:00:12.918
Yes, where is Aditya?

02:00:12.918 --> 02:00:15.088
Ah, he's going to Goya today.

02:00:15.088 --> 02:00:16.095
Why are you going to Goya?

02:00:16.095 --> 02:00:18.031
Turn the car around and go to the station.

02:00:18.031 --> 02:00:20.707
He's going to leave me and go to the beach to have fun?

02:00:20.707 --> 02:00:23.921
No Kiran, he's going to the mountains.

02:00:23.921 --> 02:00:26.954
Now there is no time to say so much, and the train will leave in an hour.

02:00:26.954 --> 02:00:28.033
What time is it now?

02:00:28.033 --> 02:00:29.744
Go faster, faster.

02:00:45.288 --> 02:00:46.248
Grandpa,

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:49.137
Give me a CD of Vyalzar.

02:01:03.704 --> 02:01:07.792
Fourteen ways to mend broken hearts,

02:01:07.792 --> 02:01:10.165
That's a lot for me.

02:01:10.165 --> 02:01:12.113
I'll take this this book too.

02:01:43.659 --> 02:01:45.025
Where did they go?

02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:49.425
Take this.

02:01:49.425 --> 02:01:50.507
- Thanks, Hemant.

02:01:53.043 --> 02:01:56.043
Please, give me your bike, I really need it.

02:01:56.043 --> 02:01:57.699
Take away.
- Thank you.

02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:34.793
Wherever you go you will hear the girl.

02:03:34.793 --> 02:03:37.869
Maya everything, don't pay attention to these.

02:03:37.869 --> 02:03:39.028
Aditya!

02:03:41.357 --> 02:03:42.725
Aditya!

02:03:43.966 --> 02:03:45.077
Aditya!

02:03:46.003 --> 02:03:48.802
Wherever you go, it seems that he is following you.

02:03:48.802 --> 02:03:51.569
This is a delusion, don't get confused.

02:03:51.569 --> 02:03:52.728
Aditya!

02:04:01.116 --> 02:04:02.333
Correct.

02:04:02.333 --> 02:04:04.385
I can hear you, I love you.

02:04:05.461 --> 02:04:07.287
I love you

02:04:07.287 --> 02:04:09.229
Wow, this is a very good book.

02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:10.800
Our Vijendra Prasad writes well!

02:04:11.839 --> 02:04:13.447
Calm your mind.

02:04:13.447 --> 02:04:14.976
Mind.

02:04:17.847 --> 02:04:20.697
I will close the window.

02:04:28.228 --> 02:04:36.964
Watch my stuff, I'll be back.

02:04:47.952 --> 02:04:49.024
Are you really here

02:04:49.103 --> 02:04:50.800
What do you mean? Are you crazy?

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.818
I'm having a difficult time because of you and you want to leave?

02:04:53.818 --> 02:04:56.099
Why are you here

02:04:56.099 --> 02:04:57.803
I love you

02:04:57.803 --> 02:04:59.901
Damn it. Go to hell

02:04:59.901 --> 02:05:02.869
Hey! Hey! My train.

02:05:02.869 --> 02:05:04.560
Hey! Hey! Here ...

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.069
Stop.

02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:07.818
Stop, stop.

02:05:08.838 --> 02:05:10.204
It left.

02:05:10.204 --> 02:05:11.653
Yalazar CDT also went.

02:05:11.653 --> 02:05:14.308
I also lost my book.

02:05:14.308 --> 02:05:17.068
I also lost my bag, all my clothes.

02:05:17.068 --> 02:05:19.921
It's all because of you.

02:05:19.921 --> 02:05:22.246
Are you angry? It doesn't suit you.

02:05:22.246 --> 02:05:24.284
So will this black color match pink?

02:05:24.284 --> 02:05:27.209
You are not normal, you are making me like before.

02:05:27.209 --> 02:05:29.451
And I readily accepted you for the second time.

02:05:29.451 --> 02:05:32.819
Uh! What did you say? Easy ...

02:05:32.819 --> 02:05:34.421
Whatever you think .. ..

02:05:34.421 --> 02:05:38.113
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.

02:05:38.113 --> 02:05:39.397
I thought,

02:05:39.397 --> 02:05:43.484
As long as you agree, I'll stay,

02:05:43.484 --> 02:05:49.646
And if that doesn't happen, it's still a way to get more involved.

02:05:49.646 --> 02:05:51.655
Like Laila-Majnu.

02:05:51.655 --> 02:05:54.727
Do it if you like.

02:05:54.727 --> 02:05:55.823
Please.

02:05:55.823 --> 02:05:57.982
What does it mean to hold a teacher like this?

02:05:57.982 --> 02:05:59.145
Well, sir.

02:05:59.145 --> 02:06:00.767
Give me a chance?

02:06:02.128 --> 02:06:04.006
What opportunities?

02:06:04.006 --> 02:06:07.354
Wipe all our old past from your head,

02:06:07.354 --> 02:06:11.065
Let's start all over again.

02:06:13.401 --> 02:06:14.545
You have learned well.

02:06:14.545 --> 02:06:16.296
Everything is learned from you.

02:06:16.296 --> 02:06:18.818
You can say that correctly, but time

02:06:23.796 --> 02:06:28.342
There are a lot of people here, don't try to do any of these.

02:06:28.342 --> 02:06:29.893
Give it to me.

02:06:29.893 --> 02:06:31.678
- I'll kill you
- Give it.

02:06:31.678 --> 02:06:34.974
I'll kill you.
- Kill me.

02:06:34.974 --> 02:06:39.273
I'll give it to you.

02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:47.425
Now they have to call! Today they are over.

02:06:47.425 --> 02:06:48.905
- Hello!
- Hello Aditya.

02:06:48.905 --> 02:06:50.915
Ah, sir.

02:06:50.915 --> 02:06:52.992
I was thinking about you sir.

02:06:52.992 --> 02:06:56.631
Are you hanging out with that girl without a shot?

02:06:56.631 --> 02:06:58.799
Did the girl say that?

02:06:58.799 --> 02:07:01.169
Sir, it's nice to say that there was a happy ending in the end.

02:07:01.169 --> 02:07:02.208
Very good, congratulations.

02:07:02.208 --> 02:07:05.435
Thank you sir, you must come to our wedding sir.

02:07:05.435 --> 02:07:08.599
Yes, of course I will. Because this marriage is very important.

02:07:08.599 --> 02:07:11.767
Bahubali 3 has been planned,
Now that is possible only after your marriage.

02:07:11.767 --> 02:07:14.474
Sir, please don't drag it with it.

02:07:14.474 --> 02:07:16.226
Only my love landed.

02:07:16.226 --> 02:07:19.016
It won't take as long as before.

02:07:19.016 --> 02:07:21.245
It may end in 3-4 years.

02:07:21.245 --> 02:07:23.358
Sir, sir, please. If I have two children,

02:07:23.358 --> 02:07:25.174
Then one has to name the beginning,
The name of the other is the conclusion.

02:07:25.174 --> 02:07:26.755
- Sir, leave it for this time.
- But ...

02:07:26.755 --> 02:07:30.333
I think you are going to be promoted from assistant director.

02:07:30.333 --> 02:07:33.547
Sir, sir, sir there is no network here, hello!

02:07:33.547 --> 02:07:34.940
Good luck.

02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:37.704
Thank you sir, well sir, goodbye.

02:07:37.704 --> 02:07:38.777
Now the signal seems strong.

02:07:46.461 --> 02:07:48.268
All this gold?

02:07:48.268 --> 02:07:49.219
Yes.

02:07:50.105 --> 02:07:54.369
I didn't know you were so rich.

02:07:53.471 --> 02:07:56.283
Well, how much will you pay as dowry?

02:07:56.283 --> 02:07:57.533
How much do you want?

02:08:02.157 --> 02:08:04.077
I would like two kids.

02:08:04.077 --> 02:08:08.192
If all three are a problem,
Because you are rich.
