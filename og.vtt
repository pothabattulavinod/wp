01:33.041 --> 01:36.041
During the Second World War,
Japan was buried in the debris.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.375
As the war ended

01:39.666 --> 01:41.500
its stability was completely destroyed.

01:44.375 --> 01:45.708
This opened the door

01:46.041 --> 01:50.375
for the underworld gang, Yakuza,
to try to seize control of Japan.

01:51.041 --> 01:54.000
Their real enemies were the samurai.

01:54.791 --> 01:58.750
They hunted each warrior
and wiped out the samurai's lineage.

01:59.291 --> 02:03.166
The survivors went into hiding
under Mount Fuji's shadow,

02:03.375 --> 02:05.541
and founded a secret society there.

02:05.916 --> 02:07.666
Black Dragon Society.

02:08.541 --> 02:10.208
They're the silent warriors

02:10.541 --> 02:13.833
who trained new soldiers
and fought the Yakuza from the shadows.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.166
But,

02:15.833 --> 02:17.500
in 1970…

02:19.166 --> 02:21.458
The Yakuza discovered the society.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.333
And the war… began!

02:35.333 --> 02:40.625
The Yakuza leader, Kazao,
ended the entire samurai lineage.

02:42.166 --> 02:45.000
The sensei was the sole survivor.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.041
The samurai still lack the strength

03:05.666 --> 03:07.750
to take down the Yakuza, Master.

03:07.833 --> 03:11.625
You have no idea
how powerful the samurai are!

03:12.208 --> 03:16.083
All you know is… violence and bloodshed!

03:17.125 --> 03:18.666
Someone like you must be--

03:22.166 --> 03:25.708
We are an army of a thousand men.
And you guys still hide in the shadows.

03:26.708 --> 03:27.666
Move!

03:29.666 --> 03:30.625
Boss!

03:32.000 --> 03:35.250
The register shows 100 students,
but there are only 99 bodies here.

03:38.708 --> 03:41.250
Wondering who the last man is?

03:41.458 --> 03:43.416
His father was an Indian

03:43.750 --> 03:47.250
who fought for Japan and died a hero.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.333
I raised the boy here
after he was orphaned.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.791
He has mastered a battle beyond wisdom.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.666
He will bring an end to the Yakuza--

04:22.958 --> 04:24.750
Not only the samurai,

04:25.208 --> 04:27.875
even commoners lost everything
because of the Yakuza.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.333
They were forced
to sell everything they owned

04:30.625 --> 04:33.208
and flee to their countries.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.458
-Add it to the cargo.
-Okay, Satya.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.500
The ship is full. There's no space.
Everyone, move back! Move!

04:43.583 --> 04:44.833
Where can they possibly go?

04:44.958 --> 04:46.375
-Get everyone aboard!
-Okay, sir!

04:59.750 --> 05:00.916
Hey, Satya!

05:01.375 --> 05:04.791
Already planning what to buy
in Bombay with this gold?

05:05.583 --> 05:08.125
This gold isn't for buying
cars or mansions.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.833
I'll buy the Colaba coastal area
and develop it into a port.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.875
A port? Why?

05:14.958 --> 05:17.583
A port can carry
heavier loads than this boat.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.583
It'll help many people earn a living.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.250
Hey! Who are you guys?
What are you doing here? Thieves--

05:57.833 --> 05:58.833
Hey! Hey! Stop!

05:59.083 --> 06:02.083
Hey, you can take the gold
if you want! Hey, let them go!

06:02.333 --> 06:04.166
Hey, let them go!

06:04.958 --> 06:07.500
Hey! Drop your gun or I'll kill him!

06:07.833 --> 06:08.875
Drop it!

06:10.083 --> 06:12.166
Eagle, oh eagle!

06:12.416 --> 06:14.250
Eagle, oh eagle!

06:14.500 --> 06:17.541
To kill a wild eagle…

07:12.041 --> 07:13.125
Bombay…

07:15.000 --> 07:17.750
To the hard-working,
it's a city of hope and dreams.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.166
I left Bombay ten years ago, chasing gold.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.750
If you hadn't boarded the ship last night…

07:26.708 --> 07:29.291
My ten years of hard work
would have sunk to the bottom of the sea.

07:31.958 --> 07:36.125
When you said that this hard-earned gold
is worth losing in order to save a life,

07:36.416 --> 07:37.875
it showed me who you truly are.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.291
Build your port for these people.

07:40.916 --> 07:41.916
In exchange…

07:43.375 --> 07:44.625
I'll stand by you.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.750
To think someone like him
is actually coming back…

10:35.666 --> 10:41.541
That Japanese ship changed
Bombay's history 23 years ago.

10:42.541 --> 10:46.791
The one arriving now
will change Bombay's future.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.125
Officers!

11:13.708 --> 11:14.916
Useless buggers!

11:18.458 --> 11:19.958
You can't do anything right.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.416
Tell me, Subedh.
What happened there?

11:26.958 --> 11:27.916
Listen, Jimmy!

11:28.750 --> 11:30.666
They've tightened the security
around the government port.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.750
-What should we do now?
-Hey, you nutcase!

11:33.166 --> 11:35.333
Dock the ship at Colaba Port immediately!

11:36.541 --> 11:38.875
But that is… Satya Dada's port.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.708
Hey! Just do as I say.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.250
Useless fools!

11:44.833 --> 11:47.083
We have to get the container out somehow.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.916
-Come quickly!
-Omi will kill us all if he finds out!

11:50.000 --> 11:51.541
He wouldn't even spare his own brother.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.458
By relation, I'm like your father…

12:07.000 --> 12:08.458
My name is Shahenshah!

12:12.500 --> 12:14.833
All the ships for today
have docked already, right?

12:15.666 --> 12:16.708
What's this?

12:17.333 --> 12:20.458
Mr. Kuldeep said it's a VIP emergency
and ordered us to update it, sir.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.291
Hey, what's happening here?

12:28.833 --> 12:31.750
Where are you taking the container
before inspection, Kuldeep?

12:38.583 --> 12:39.958
Hey! Lower it!

12:48.833 --> 12:51.458
-Whose container is this?
-It is Jimmy's!

12:51.833 --> 12:53.208
It belongs to Jimmy, brother!

12:53.333 --> 12:55.125
Hey, Pardhu, my childhood friend!

12:55.208 --> 12:57.125
This is where we used to play
cops and robbers, right?

12:57.250 --> 13:00.166
I swear we used to play
cops and robbers here!

13:00.500 --> 13:02.333
This scene brings back those memories.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.583
Hey, Kuldeep,
that's our container. Leave it.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.666
-Hey, lower it!
-Hey!

13:07.208 --> 13:10.250
-That's our container. Leave it.
-This is Satya Dada's port!

13:11.041 --> 13:14.333
Not even a piece of coal
leaves the port without permission.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.208
What's up with him?

13:26.958 --> 13:28.291
Today, you be the cop.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.291
Start the countdown.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.000
-Go!
-Okay… okay!

13:34.708 --> 13:35.750
Ten…

13:36.750 --> 13:37.625
Nine…

13:37.833 --> 13:38.875
Lower it!

13:39.000 --> 13:40.125
Eight…

13:40.583 --> 13:41.916
-Seven.
-Bring it down.

13:43.083 --> 13:43.916
Six…

13:44.000 --> 13:45.208
-Open it up.
-Okay, sir.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.666
Five…

13:48.000 --> 13:49.083
Four…

13:50.541 --> 13:51.416
Three…

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Two…

13:54.625 --> 13:55.625
One.

13:56.916 --> 13:57.875
RDX!

14:12.041 --> 14:13.000
Suleiman!

14:13.208 --> 14:14.458
Kill those idiots!

14:20.666 --> 14:21.583
Lift it up! Come on!

14:24.625 --> 14:26.125
Hey! Catch him!

14:29.416 --> 14:30.625
-Boss! Let's go.
-Come, Jimmy!

14:30.791 --> 14:32.250
-Come fast!
-Oh, no…

14:32.333 --> 14:33.625
We can't just leave the container.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.708
-That's ours!
-Bhadra, get the car!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.166
-JD! Come on, let's go.
-Let's get out of here quickly.

14:38.250 --> 14:39.250
Hurry up, let's go.

14:40.666 --> 14:42.125
-Jimmy, listen to me.
-Let's go!

14:42.208 --> 14:43.291
-Get in the car!
-Hurry! Move!

14:43.375 --> 14:44.250
Start the car.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.583
-Come on, Boss!
-Start the car!

14:46.458 --> 14:48.125
Naga! Check over there!

14:55.250 --> 14:56.166
Dheena!

15:01.125 --> 15:05.375
That one death…
changed Bombay's fate forever.

15:15.958 --> 15:16.958
Hello?

15:28.375 --> 15:31.000
The CM is in a meeting.
It'll be over in ten minutes.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.291
Sir…

15:33.083 --> 15:36.166
-What happened?
-I heard Jimmy killed Satya's son!

15:41.208 --> 15:42.125
Jimmy!

15:42.958 --> 15:43.875
Jimmy!

15:45.208 --> 15:48.500
-Did you kill Pardhu?
-Did you wake me up for this?

15:49.333 --> 15:52.875
Because… his father is Satya Dada.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.083
Satya Dada!

16:33.250 --> 16:34.208
Arjun?

16:38.666 --> 16:39.500
Arjun!

16:43.416 --> 16:44.958
The one who died is your uncle, right?

16:46.166 --> 16:48.666
Death in our family
is as common as storms in Bombay.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.041
It's my uncle today.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.000
Fifteen years ago…

16:56.833 --> 16:57.833
It was my dad.

16:59.541 --> 17:01.583
-Mom…
-Arjun…

17:09.416 --> 17:10.416
What is this, Arjun?

17:11.541 --> 17:12.875
You're the family heir.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.583
You should be in the front.
Why are you here at the back?

17:18.583 --> 17:19.708
Well…

17:20.291 --> 17:22.041
Everyone you name as the heir

17:23.458 --> 17:25.916
is meeting their end rather too soon.

17:27.458 --> 17:28.875
Don't add me to the list.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.458
Mr. Dharani, tell Mom that I'm back.

17:36.416 --> 17:37.625
Don't tell her I had a smoke.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.250
Aren't you ashamed, Mr. IG?

17:39.458 --> 17:41.708
Instead of finding
who killed Pardhu at the port,

17:41.916 --> 17:43.666
you've come here asking for a statement.

17:43.750 --> 17:44.791
Geetha…

17:45.458 --> 17:46.916
Mirajkar is here.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.833
They'd gone their separate ways,
but this death has forced them to meet.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.250
Who knows what's next?

18:24.541 --> 18:28.375
Whoever is behind Pardhu's death...
We won't spare him!

18:29.583 --> 18:33.000
I'll bring him down…
even if he's the mightiest of all!

18:49.791 --> 18:52.708
We'll know what's next soon enough.

18:52.958 --> 18:53.916
-Let's go.
-Hey!

18:54.583 --> 18:55.541
Lakshmi…

19:01.125 --> 19:02.000
Hey!

19:02.750 --> 19:04.541
What is this? Will you hit me?

19:04.833 --> 19:06.041
Will you really hit me?

19:06.916 --> 19:07.833
Hey!

19:08.291 --> 19:09.500
Hey, hey!

19:10.333 --> 19:12.166
Hey! Hey… Stop her!

19:12.333 --> 19:14.333
Hey, Dad! Stop her! Stop her!

19:31.541 --> 19:32.458
Jimmy…

19:34.875 --> 19:37.541
We're stopping with just this
as he's a suspect in Pardhu's murder.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.916
Things would be very different
if that's proven.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.291
I hope you know who will come back now.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.208
Arjun, what led to their conflict?

19:57.583 --> 19:58.666
The port.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.416
What are you thinking now?

20:07.500 --> 20:11.000
You stood silently
while she hit me in front of everyone.

20:11.583 --> 20:12.750
What could I do?

20:15.208 --> 20:17.333
What do you even know about me?

20:18.541 --> 20:20.583
The port had a thousand people…

20:22.416 --> 20:24.666
We had surrounded it from all sides.

20:25.916 --> 20:28.708
And I had Satya trapped inside.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.666
They put chains around my neck.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.166
Grandpa…

20:43.250 --> 20:45.041
They tried to scare him.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.875
And beat him up badly.

20:48.958 --> 20:53.375
-No one's coming to save you.
-I had an army of hundreds.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.666
Can anyone overcome all of this?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.041
Is that possible?

21:06.625 --> 21:08.666
Grandpa...

21:50.666 --> 21:55.000
A storm alert was issued
off the Bombay coast.

22:29.958 --> 22:30.875
Who was he?

22:32.125 --> 22:33.041
Who?

22:52.708 --> 22:54.000
Boogeyman!

22:59.791 --> 23:01.750
When a cyclone strikes…

23:05.916 --> 23:07.375
Bow down to the tide.

23:09.791 --> 23:11.375
When OG comes…

23:15.041 --> 23:16.541
You run and hide!

24:20.541 --> 24:21.583
Hey…

24:23.083 --> 24:27.333
Any real men here?
Step up and claim this port!

24:29.625 --> 24:33.666
This port was built with the help
of the gold that you saved 15 years ago.

24:34.208 --> 24:36.875
Even after witnessing it, they defied you.

24:37.458 --> 24:38.666
Such audacity

24:40.000 --> 24:41.875
must be destroyed today, Gambheera.

24:44.958 --> 24:47.583
What are you waiting for? Kill him!

25:03.625 --> 25:05.791
Hey! Pull out your guns!

25:05.875 --> 25:07.666
-Quickly! Get them out now!
-Come on!

25:58.583 --> 26:01.708
Hey! Don't let him
touch the sword! Push it away!

26:56.583 --> 26:57.500
Hey…

27:03.125 --> 27:04.166
Come on!

27:12.708 --> 27:14.083
-Dheena…
-Yes, Gambheera.

27:14.416 --> 27:15.500
Anybody left?

27:15.833 --> 27:16.833
Just one guy.

27:16.916 --> 27:18.958
Gambheera, forgive me!

27:19.333 --> 27:20.416
I made a mistake!

27:20.500 --> 27:23.500
I won't repeat this!
Forgive me, Gambheera!

27:23.583 --> 27:25.125
-Please forgive me.
-Hey!

27:32.625 --> 27:35.916
If you ever strike against Dada again

27:37.666 --> 27:39.666
or even think of seizing this port,

27:40.458 --> 27:43.583
I won't be talking to you,
but to your headless corpse.

27:45.666 --> 27:46.541
Get lost!

27:52.250 --> 27:54.875
They'd only measure
the amount of rainfall until then.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.000
But they measured
the amount of bloodshed that day.

28:14.083 --> 28:18.125
The heat of that bloodshed…
reached every corner of Bombay.

28:31.083 --> 28:33.250
They hoisted that blood-stained shirt

28:33.958 --> 28:35.750
as a flag!

28:45.041 --> 28:46.750
If you bother Dada again,

28:47.541 --> 28:48.666
that sword

28:49.208 --> 28:52.250
will reach your neck, my son.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.833
Where is Gambheera now?
Why isn't he here?

28:58.791 --> 29:01.875
He left Bombay… 15 years ago.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.625
-Fifteen years?
-Why, Arjun?

29:09.250 --> 29:11.166
Because Gambheera is the one

29:11.375 --> 29:14.541
who killed Dada's eldest son, my dad.

29:20.750 --> 29:24.708
A death in this family will
definitely bring him back to Bombay.

29:25.416 --> 29:27.833
Until I spill his blood with my own hands,

29:30.416 --> 29:32.166
I won't set foot in this house again.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.583
Sir, this man, OG…

29:36.958 --> 29:41.250
He put an end to gang wars
in Bombay 15 years ago.

29:41.416 --> 29:44.541
This port murder
will rouse them again, sir.

29:45.041 --> 29:47.958
Explain it in detail, Mr. IG.

29:48.041 --> 29:51.958
Last week, they noticed a suspicious ship
in the Indian international waters.

29:52.166 --> 29:55.541
Later, it disappeared from the radar
and turned up in Satya Dada's port.

29:55.708 --> 29:59.250
An investigation revealed that the murder
is directly related to that container.

29:59.791 --> 30:01.541
Call me immediately, Jimmy.

30:02.333 --> 30:06.166
Our intel report says that
the container is dangerous, sir.

30:06.416 --> 30:09.166
Sir, we've received confirmation
that Jimmy killed Dada's son, Pardhu.

30:18.291 --> 30:21.500
Everyone who came to the wake

30:22.166 --> 30:23.500
knows who the murderer is.

30:33.041 --> 30:37.791
The man behind it
is scarier than the container.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.916
If Pardhu's death is to matter,

30:47.416 --> 30:50.291
they must never
get hold of this container.

30:57.416 --> 30:58.625
-Mr. IG.
-Sir!

30:59.083 --> 31:02.208
This isn't the old Bombay.
Dada's power has weakened.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.541
Even OG isn't by his side right now.

31:11.958 --> 31:13.666
OG hasn't returned in 10 years.

31:13.958 --> 31:17.625
There's no guarantee that he'll return
under these circumstances.

31:38.958 --> 31:39.833
Tell me, Jimmy.

31:39.958 --> 31:44.208
Tawde, the container must be taken
out of Satya Dada's port somehow.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.000
I don't know what you'll do.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.958
Don't worry, Jimmy.
I'll take care of it.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.916
All the goods must be loaded by evening.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.416
Are you blind?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.416
Bloody idiots! How dare you
use the port for illegal smuggling!

32:14.583 --> 32:16.166
Hey, take him away! Go.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.250
Move, you idiot!

32:20.166 --> 32:21.416
Hey, move!

32:23.041 --> 32:25.375
-Move! Move!
-Hey, take him away!

32:25.750 --> 32:27.458
-Come here!
-Hey!

32:31.291 --> 32:33.791
Go to Dada's house
and tell him that the cops are here.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.208
-Okay, Mom!
-Go quickly!

32:36.750 --> 32:38.208
Hey, move!

32:38.416 --> 32:40.833
Hey, move, you wastrel! Move!

32:46.041 --> 32:48.625
-Hey!
-Hey, let me go!

32:49.875 --> 32:51.541
All of you, listen up!

32:51.791 --> 32:55.458
We've received information
about illegal smuggling at the port.

32:55.708 --> 32:58.916
Please cooperate with the cops
and avoid unnecessary conflict.

33:09.083 --> 33:10.833
Sir, the container is here!

33:23.583 --> 33:26.458
There... There are cops at the port.

33:38.208 --> 33:39.208
Did you find it?

33:39.416 --> 33:43.208
Where the hell have you guys
hidden the container? Where?

33:46.416 --> 33:50.458
The container isn't here.
You're not saying where you hid it.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.625
If I lay my hands on you,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.250
will they talk then?

33:56.625 --> 33:59.000
I must check you. Okay?

33:59.750 --> 34:00.791
Hey!

34:01.208 --> 34:02.666
Hey… Tawde!

34:08.708 --> 34:10.625
-Hey!
-Sir, sir! Let go, sir.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.041
This won't end well.

34:26.791 --> 34:28.833
-Lower your gun!
-What if I don't?

34:31.166 --> 34:32.208
Are you mad?

34:33.666 --> 34:35.125
Are you threatening a cop?

34:35.375 --> 34:38.166
I can have the whole port seized
with just one phone call.

34:38.291 --> 34:39.875
I'll make a call too.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.875
But before that,
I'll shoot you and go to jail.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.500
Then I will call the MP
and come out on bail.

34:47.875 --> 34:51.583
As soon as I'm out, I'll go to the houses
of everyone who has come here with you,

34:51.666 --> 34:55.000
shoot them, and make another call!

34:55.166 --> 34:56.291
You want that?

35:01.375 --> 35:04.041
Hey! Let's go, everyone. Move! Move!

35:13.541 --> 35:15.958
Speak up! Speak, you lowlife! Speak!

35:27.625 --> 35:29.750
That container is not in the port.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
We searched everywhere,
but couldn't find it.

35:36.875 --> 35:37.875
You won't tell me?

35:38.583 --> 35:40.208
We don't know anything!

35:40.791 --> 35:41.958
Please let us go!

35:43.416 --> 35:45.875
The old man who hid the container…

35:48.000 --> 35:49.208
Satya Dada…

35:51.458 --> 35:52.583
Where is he?

36:20.875 --> 36:23.125
My brother finally
trusted me with something.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.916
You can't even do that right.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.375
That old geezer.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.333
I'll kill everyone!
Every single one of them!

36:32.541 --> 36:33.583
Nashik!

36:36.791 --> 36:38.750
He's gone to Nashik… with Pardhu's ashes!

36:42.666 --> 36:44.958
-Yes, hello?
-Uncle Pathan.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.833
Yes, Jimmy!

36:47.458 --> 36:50.125
Long time, no see.
How are you?

36:50.500 --> 36:52.875
One of our preys
has strayed into your territory.

36:53.541 --> 36:55.166
Oh! No problem.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.958
I'll catch whoever it is.
What's his name?

36:58.958 --> 36:59.958
Satya Dada.

37:04.708 --> 37:06.958
Satya Dada…

37:07.125 --> 37:10.083
Once I come there,
let's finish him off together.

37:24.083 --> 37:26.208
Our people who arrested by Tawde

37:26.500 --> 37:28.416
-weren't at the station.
-You've got a call!

37:28.583 --> 37:30.083
-He says it's Bhadra!
-Bhadra?!

37:31.375 --> 37:32.333
Bhadra?

37:35.250 --> 37:36.958
-Hello?
-Uncle, it's me, Bhadra.

37:37.125 --> 37:38.791
Bhadra, tell me.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.375
-He knows... Dada is... in Nashik.
-Hello? Hello?

37:45.083 --> 37:47.333
-Who is Bhadra?
-One of our men.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.916
He's been working for them for ten years.

37:52.625 --> 37:54.666
-What happened, Bhadra?
-Dheena…

37:54.833 --> 37:57.083
Dheena, Jimmy has learned
that Dada is in Nashik.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.583
He's on his way to kill him.

37:58.916 --> 38:01.333
He's got over thirty people with him.
Hurry up and do something, Dheena!

38:01.500 --> 38:04.208
-Hey, Bhadra! Come fast.
-Yes! I'm coming!

38:06.750 --> 38:09.541
It looks like they're trying to kill Dada.

38:09.708 --> 38:10.541
Dada?

38:11.166 --> 38:13.291
Geetha, I have to go.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.250
Take care of the port.

38:17.125 --> 38:19.041
Nashik's only 100 km away, Jimmy.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.458
Today, that old man dies at your hands!

38:22.708 --> 38:24.083
We'll catch that old man!

38:24.958 --> 38:26.208
Let's go, Jimmy!

38:29.250 --> 38:33.500
If they've traced Dada, the situation
is slipping out of our control.

38:35.666 --> 38:38.833
Let's talk to all the politicians we know.

38:39.625 --> 38:43.250
Mr. Amit, Vittal, Joshi and Gurunath.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.000
There must be at least one person

38:48.083 --> 38:49.875
-willing to stand by us, right?
-Yes, there is.

38:50.166 --> 38:52.333
In fact, we have many supporters.

38:53.250 --> 38:57.291
But there's only one…
who'd dare oppose them.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.708
Just one man.

39:04.125 --> 39:06.708
You saw Gambheera? When?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.208
I went to meet him.

39:11.458 --> 39:12.458
Seven years ago…

39:14.416 --> 39:15.333
In Madurai.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.791
-Yes, tell me?
-Sir!

39:21.000 --> 39:24.500
There's a beheaded corpse
in Ganapathy Lodge, please come quickly.

39:25.833 --> 39:27.083
GANAPATHY LODGE

39:32.166 --> 39:33.791
WELCOME
THIS WAY

39:47.125 --> 39:51.666
They said they'd never seen
such a crime scene in their lives.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.375
And that a man who was
a guest at the lodge that day

39:55.916 --> 39:57.541
killed them all

39:57.625 --> 40:02.458
to rescue 40 girls from human trafficking.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.416
It was our Gambheera!

40:29.041 --> 40:30.875
MADURAI POLICE STATION

40:32.208 --> 40:34.458
Sir, he's the one
who killed them all.

40:36.583 --> 40:39.083
Hey, why did you let him sit there?

40:39.166 --> 40:41.291
You'll understand when you look
at the contents of his bag.

40:41.666 --> 40:43.125
What's in the bag? Open it.

40:58.500 --> 41:01.833
A ship pass from Japan to Madras--

41:10.208 --> 41:13.583
-Hey! He is not an ordinary man.
-Sir?

41:30.500 --> 41:32.458
Sir, shall I file an FIR for 20 murders--

41:34.375 --> 41:37.416
Do you remember the big storm
that hit Bombay ten years ago?

41:39.791 --> 41:45.041
Even that storm couldn't wash away
all the blood he spilled.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.333
It was a freaking blood bath!

41:52.375 --> 41:54.166
If he has returned…

42:39.833 --> 42:42.833
Do as I say.
Send him out the back door.

42:43.416 --> 42:44.791
That's our best option.

43:02.583 --> 43:04.708
I'll never forget that day!

43:06.375 --> 43:10.458
The SI was too scared to even
discuss what had happened that day.

43:12.458 --> 43:14.833
After that, I called
the police station a few times.

43:15.541 --> 43:17.250
I inquired in the surrounding areas.

43:17.958 --> 43:19.583
No matter what I asked them,

43:20.750 --> 43:22.333
they only gave me one name.

43:23.916 --> 43:24.833
Kanmani?

43:28.208 --> 43:29.166
Yes!

43:30.166 --> 43:31.000
Kanmani!

43:31.833 --> 43:35.041
That name sounds familiar… One moment.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.875
To the revered Mr. Satyanarayana.

43:58.875 --> 44:02.041
You may not know how I am related to you,

44:02.875 --> 44:06.333
but I'm close to someone
you know very well.

44:07.791 --> 44:09.583
My name is Kanmani.

44:13.291 --> 44:15.500
I'm a doctor working in Madurai.

44:16.041 --> 44:20.458
The patients who come to me
for treatment are my only family.

44:23.291 --> 44:27.041
But you became my real kin through him.

44:27.833 --> 44:30.041
His name… is Gambheera.

44:50.541 --> 44:51.583
Hey!

44:56.250 --> 44:57.291
Stand up!

44:59.750 --> 45:00.750
Begin!

45:02.750 --> 45:03.583
Gambheera…

45:04.458 --> 45:07.416
This is Eli. He's the head
of the Indian Aikido Federation.

45:07.791 --> 45:08.750
Disperse!

45:11.958 --> 45:14.791
Gambheera, I've never heard about you.

45:15.208 --> 45:18.875
There's no account of you learning
Aikido anywhere in the federation books.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.166
Master Surya said
that you learned Aikido in Japan.

45:22.291 --> 45:24.625
If what you are saying
is all true, come fight me!

45:24.791 --> 45:27.083
And prove that
you are not a bloody cheater!

45:27.250 --> 45:28.625
Don't talk rubbish, Eli!

45:48.625 --> 45:51.500
Doctor, someone's fighting with Gambheera.

46:16.500 --> 46:17.458
Gambheera!

46:22.833 --> 46:25.291
We didn't discuss the prize, right?

46:25.791 --> 46:26.791
How about her?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.166
When his loved ones were in danger,

46:59.916 --> 47:03.833
I saw the full extent
of Gambheera’s fury that day.

47:53.250 --> 47:54.208
What are you doing?

47:55.291 --> 47:57.833
It's not a toy sword! It's a katana!

47:58.000 --> 47:59.750
-I know!
-What do you know?

48:00.666 --> 48:03.666
Why are you packing? There's a truck
downstairs and people are rushing about.

48:05.541 --> 48:08.166
-We're moving to a new house.
-Where are we going?

48:08.833 --> 48:09.791
Somewhere else.

48:10.708 --> 48:12.250
You must leave the violence behind.

48:13.166 --> 48:16.000
I have my dojo here and you have
your clinic. Where are we going?

48:16.375 --> 48:17.375
Somewhere else!

48:17.708 --> 48:20.125
-Why do you care?
-Kanmani, where are we going?

48:20.208 --> 48:21.833
-Why?
-Tell me where we're going!

48:22.083 --> 48:23.791
I'm asking you! Tell me!

48:24.208 --> 48:25.291
Why are we leaving?

48:28.041 --> 48:29.750
This isn't for you and me.

48:32.125 --> 48:34.666
-Who is it for then?
-Not for the two of us.

50:38.166 --> 50:40.916
It'd be nice to have
some family support right now.

50:43.500 --> 50:44.791
We have no one, Kanmani.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.125
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

53:01.708 --> 53:02.583
Come.

53:18.333 --> 53:20.333
What were you doing before our marriage?

53:28.875 --> 53:30.125
No!

53:36.750 --> 53:38.666
-Ah…
-I just asked casually.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.041
Not to be nosy.

53:45.875 --> 53:47.708
Stop writing letters to Dada.

53:53.041 --> 53:54.458
We have no one.

53:55.291 --> 53:56.500
No one will come to our aid.

53:57.750 --> 53:59.750
I wanted to reunite you with Dada.

54:01.000 --> 54:01.958
But no need for that.

54:02.333 --> 54:03.750
We are here for you.

54:05.708 --> 54:08.208
This will be my last letter to you.

54:09.333 --> 54:11.541
I never intended to trouble you.

54:11.916 --> 54:16.375
But the one who'll always stand by you
at the time of your need,

54:17.541 --> 54:19.000
is my husband, Gambheera.

54:19.625 --> 54:21.916
With regards, Kanmani.

54:26.625 --> 54:31.625
Ask CI Tawde to release the men
he arrested at our port.

54:31.916 --> 54:34.208
You're only concerned
about your employees.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.125
But I'm more concerned
about the danger coming your way.

54:39.291 --> 54:43.958
Do you know who owns
the container that came to your port?

54:45.041 --> 54:45.875
Omi!

54:58.958 --> 54:59.875
Omi!

55:00.375 --> 55:01.250
He's sitting there.

55:17.875 --> 55:20.375
David trusts nobody!
So how did he trust you?

55:21.750 --> 55:23.791
Seems like the container
went missing in Bombay. Right?

55:25.541 --> 55:28.833
I have a question.
Do you know what RDX is?

55:30.541 --> 55:34.000
Give David one good reason
to spare your life.

55:34.458 --> 55:37.000
The demon is watching us.
Don't look back.

55:38.583 --> 55:39.500
Demon?

55:41.541 --> 55:43.833
Will the demon eat me or something?

55:45.083 --> 55:47.958
His brother bragged like this, too.

55:48.416 --> 55:51.666
But the idiot lost a valuable container.

55:53.500 --> 55:56.916
Where is your… Demon?

56:35.041 --> 56:36.583
This is just a sample.

56:38.375 --> 56:42.041
That container…
carries a thousand times more.

56:42.291 --> 56:44.250
I'll go to Bombay myself.

56:44.750 --> 56:46.541
I'll give you a good show!

57:10.208 --> 57:11.666
Omkar Vardhaman!

57:11.875 --> 57:13.333
Mirajkar's eldest son.

57:13.708 --> 57:15.625
He grew up outside India…

57:16.166 --> 57:18.875
From drug cartels to mafia dons,

57:19.375 --> 57:23.583
Omi committed countless crimes
with their backing.

57:27.875 --> 57:30.000
That container isn't just cargo.

57:30.625 --> 57:32.625
It's his entire empire's lifeline.

57:33.125 --> 57:34.833
He'll definitely come
to Bombay to get it back.

57:40.791 --> 57:41.625
So…

57:42.250 --> 57:43.958
Did you find out anything about Dada?

57:49.916 --> 57:53.375
MAHARASTRA STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT
DISTRICT GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, NASHIK

58:02.166 --> 58:03.375
Madam, may I make a call?

58:05.291 --> 58:06.250
Taara!

58:07.166 --> 58:08.125
Have you seen Taara?

58:08.208 --> 58:09.458
-She went that way, ma'am.
-That way?

58:10.791 --> 58:11.666
Taara!

58:17.291 --> 58:18.333
Taara!

58:19.750 --> 58:20.833
Taara!

58:21.541 --> 58:23.083
Where are you going without eating?

58:23.666 --> 58:25.708
I've told you already!
How many times must I say it?

58:25.791 --> 58:26.750
Kanmani…

58:28.166 --> 58:29.125
How are you, dear?

58:33.208 --> 58:34.375
Dada, is it really you?

58:35.125 --> 58:36.041
How are you?

58:38.666 --> 58:40.000
Did you receive my letters?

58:41.166 --> 58:45.166
Since you didn't reply,
I thought you hadn't received them.

58:46.083 --> 58:47.791
I stayed away all these days

58:48.541 --> 58:51.458
as I didn't want to burden him
with my dreams and needs, dear.

58:52.750 --> 58:53.750
But now…

58:54.750 --> 58:56.666
the entire Bombay needs him.

59:29.583 --> 59:32.083
-Tell me, Kanmani.
-Can you come to the hospital?

59:32.541 --> 59:35.208
-I'll come, but it'll take some time.
-Come quickly.

59:36.666 --> 59:37.708
What happened?

59:38.416 --> 59:39.458
Your father is here.

59:43.916 --> 59:46.750
How are you related to my father?

59:48.500 --> 59:50.833
Dada, as long as I live…

59:52.041 --> 59:53.166
this house…

59:54.916 --> 59:56.625
and your two sons…

59:58.375 --> 59:59.333
will be safe!

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:02.083
I don't have two sons…

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
but three.

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:24.000
Come, darling.

01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:28.875
DISTRICT GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, NASHIK

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.041
-Look! The real fun begins now!
-Move, move!

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:37.125
-Move, move!
-Move!

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:40.833
It looks like he'll destroy
the whole hospital at this pace!

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:42.666
-Jimmy!
-Where is that old man?

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.250
-We'll kill him today!
-Over there.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:46.791
Go, go, go! Find him!

01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:05.708
What's happening?

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:08.625
Dada, Jimmy's men have surrounded
the hospital to catch you.

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:12.958
Kanmani, no.

01:01:13.583 --> 01:01:15.458
Don't tell him I was here. Take her.

01:01:17.666 --> 01:01:19.541
-What happened, Dada? Da…
-There's some danger outside. Stay here!

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:29.416
Everyone down!

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:49.208
Jimmy, we need the old man alive.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.208
Let's go!

01:02:06.166 --> 01:02:07.166
Search over there.

01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:41.041
Dada, come.

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:42.416
Come, Dada, come.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:44.416
Come.

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:46.166
Come quickly!

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:02.791
Jimmy!

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:05.041
Come quickly!
The old man got away!

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.458
Sir! Omi is in Bombay.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.125
He went towards the port.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.250
Hello?

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:44.708
Geetha, I am at the hospital.
Jimmy's men have set it on fire!

01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:47.875
Doctors, patients, kids…
They haven't spared anyone!

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.125
Idiot, sit down!

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.375
Hey!

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:09.625
Put down your guns!

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.333
I know that my container is in this port.

01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:04.125
Imagine how valuable it is…
if I've personally come to collect it.

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:10.000
Very soon, my brother

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:13.041
will hold a knife to Satya Dada's throat

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:15.125
and tell me my container's location.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:27.000
Hey, Jimmy!

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.666
Stop him quickly.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:32.041
I won't just stop him.
I'll kill that idiot today!

01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:35.208
-Mom…
-Ganga… Ganga…

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:37.375
-Ganga… Ganga…
-Mom… Mom…

01:05:40.916 --> 01:05:43.083
Geetha came here to save you.

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:46.708
But who will come to save her?

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:53.000
Bring whoever you want.

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:55.083
Go.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.041
Run!

01:06:05.416 --> 01:06:07.208
Hey, here.
Kill him with this.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:13.375
Ganga! Ganga!

01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:16.708
Ganga!

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:18.166
Ganga!

01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:33.000
-Ganga! Ganga!
-Oh, no… Ganga!

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:35.000
Let me go!

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:40.166
-Hey!
-Where are you going?

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.291
-Let me go!
-Keep quiet.

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:43.291
I've only used one bullet, Geetha.

01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:47.625
But for every step you take,
I'll shoot another one.

01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:49.125
And one more person will die.

01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:56.416
Tick-tock…

01:06:56.791 --> 01:06:58.125
Tick-tock…

01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:03.500
Jimmy, the old man has escaped.

01:07:03.583 --> 01:07:05.833
That geezer will be
hiding here somewhere.

01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:10.500
To lure the rat,

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:12.666
we must smoke it out.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:16.541
Hey!

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.000
Hey! Stop, please!

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.208
Hey, hey, hey!

01:07:51.708 --> 01:07:53.125
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:54.958
From now on, this port is…

01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:56.958
Ours.

01:07:57.958 --> 01:07:59.750
If we find the container,

01:08:00.666 --> 01:08:03.750
no one… can stop us.

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.000
Have you seen him?

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:09.500
Hey, look!
What's going on over there?

01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:21.833
Tell me where the container is.

01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:27.333
Hey! They're here!

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:30.458
Dada, please run away!

01:08:30.583 --> 01:08:33.458
If you tell me, the little girl will live.

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:36.958
And this port will prosper.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:43.500
The time limit Omi
gave you is almost over.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.208
Don't overthink it.

01:08:52.458 --> 01:08:53.416
I'll tell you.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.208
But before that,

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.125
I want to tell you all a story.

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:02.416
Years ago,

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:07.333
a man came into the kingdom
as a supporter of the king.

01:09:07.916 --> 01:09:11.500
He came to offer support,
but they thought he came to hide.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.708
But he stood by the king
with his head held high

01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:19.958
like a true protector!

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.958
-We found the old man!
-Bring that idiot here.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:27.750
Though not bound by blood,

01:09:28.458 --> 01:09:32.208
the people believed that
he was the rightful heir to the kingdom.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.916
We found the old man!

01:09:37.833 --> 01:09:40.916
Maybe the fear of death drove the enemies…

01:09:41.333 --> 01:09:43.333
to pray.

01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:45.875
Because one day,

01:09:46.208 --> 01:09:48.333
that man drifted away

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:50.750
from the king and the kingdom.

01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.791
DISTRICT GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, NASHIK

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.625
Kan… Kanmani…

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.916
Kanmani.

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:21.208
Kanmani.

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.583
Hey, D-Doctor.

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.875
-Your father… your father…
-Kanmani…

01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:31.625
is in da… danger…

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:35.458
For love, he even gave up war.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.333
And now you've killed his love.

01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:44.541
All that he has now is… war!

01:10:57.666 --> 01:10:59.458
Catch the old man! Catch him!

01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:01.708
Search this side!
Check over there! Don't let him escape!

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:06.458
-They killed Bannu! Bannu…
-Jimmy, wait!

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:12.083
Who?

01:11:12.875 --> 01:11:14.166
Who are you talking about?

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:16.125
Tell me who it is!

01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:22.333
Hey... It's not him, is it?

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.208
It's not him, right?

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:27.708
Tell me!

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:13.916
My son will handle everything now.

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:38.625
Hey!

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.833
Ga… Gambheera.

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:07.250
Gambheera.

01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:09.208
Gambheera…

01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:30.625
Boogeyman!

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.875
Is he the boogeyman my dad told me about?

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:46.541
I prayed to Satan
for his return every single day.

01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:55.625
The Satan you spoke of, prays to him…

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.416
not to return!

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.541
GAMBHEERA

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:11.791
Hey… Your time is up.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.833
Gambheera's time starts now.

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.125
Hey!

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:25.708
The call is for you.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:36.666
Your brother’s been beheaded.

01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:39.166
You're up next!

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:42.500
OG is coming!

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:47.708
I don't know if it'll be his or mine…

01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:51.541
But a head… will definitely roll!

01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:02.958
Kanmani…

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:06.208
K-Kanmani… Kanmani…

01:17:10.416 --> 01:17:13.333
I didn't know…

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:16.250
if I’d get to see you again.

01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:17.833
Doc… Doctor!

01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:22.291
I couldn’t stay with you longer

01:17:22.833 --> 01:17:25.958
to support you in this life.

01:17:57.958 --> 01:17:59.791
Kanmani… Kanmani…

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.625
Dada, where are you going?

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:40.916
Without a lion to hunt them,
the foxes are running wild in the jungle.

01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:44.958
It's time for Gambheera to hunt again.

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:03.833
Jimmy…

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:07.416
Jimmy!

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:10.333
No! No! No!

01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:13.000
No… This…

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.916
This can't be my son, Jimmy!

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.583
This can't be my Jimmy!

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:20.333
-Jimmy!
-Jimmy…

01:20:42.708 --> 01:20:46.250
It took us all night
to track down Jimmy's head.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:21:00.333
Everything's the same
as before, except for the rain.

01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:03.333
Not the rain…

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:07.500
They issued an even bigger danger
alert on the radio this morning.

01:21:07.791 --> 01:21:08.916
What was the alert about?

01:21:34.208 --> 01:21:37.291
Look at him boldly smoking
in Mirajkar's house!

01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:39.708
That isn't his boldness.

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:42.416
So, what was the alert on the radio?

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:43.500
Hey!

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:47.041
A storm is on its way.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.833
Gambheera…

01:22:24.583 --> 01:22:27.000
He's coming back?

01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:53.291
Brother, we need
two days. I'm not bluffing.

01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:55.833
-Sir! Sir!
-I swear. What happened?

01:22:55.916 --> 01:22:57.375
Gambheera has come back to Bombay, sir.

01:22:57.833 --> 01:22:58.958
-Gambheera?
-Yes!

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.916
Sir, as I was saying…

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:08.708
He hung up the moment
he heard Gambheera's name.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:54.708
Hey, Tawde. How are you?

01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:58.958
I welcome you…

01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:01.458
to my police station.

01:24:02.208 --> 01:24:06.250
Where did Omi hide our employees
and Geetha? Tell me.

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.875
The people from your port?

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:19.458
Dang! I can't recall where I hid them.

01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:22.250
Where did I hide them?
Hey! Where are the people from the port?

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.791
Let me check if they're in here. Are they?

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.458
They're not here.

01:24:32.166 --> 01:24:33.916
If you want to check, come on.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.166
-You...
-You're most welcome!

01:24:35.708 --> 01:24:36.833
Dheena…

01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:43.083
I heard they call you "Tiger."

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:46.125
Are you really a tiger?

01:24:52.333 --> 01:24:55.708
Alright, maybe you are a tiger.

01:24:56.791 --> 01:25:00.208
But… the world has changed now.

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:04.958
The world today favors the fastest runner.

01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:06.708
You tigers…

01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:08.958
have grown old.

01:25:10.416 --> 01:25:12.833
Rusty guns were used in your era.

01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:14.875
Let me show you
what a real gun looks like today.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.916
This generation's super-fast gun!

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:19.208
Look! Have you seen this piece?

01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:20.541
Ever heard its name?

01:25:20.958 --> 01:25:23.000
Watch, I'll show you the magic.

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:28.291
Do you know what it's called, son?
A double-barrel gun.

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:31.708
This finger…

01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:34.916
will now decide your future!

01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:41.333
Speak now.

01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:45.125
Tawde… shoot me. Shoot.

01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:48.000
-Pull the trigger! Yes!
-Shall I pull it?

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:57.458
Parvesh…

01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:01.250
-Parvesh!
-Yes, Gambheera.

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:03.416
Grab his hand.

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:06.833
-Hold his hand tight!
-Bring me the cigarettes.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.416
I said, hold his hand!

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.083
Hold his hand!

01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:13.875
Hey! You losers! Disloyal dogs!

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:16.541
Pull out his finger!

01:26:17.375 --> 01:26:18.750
Pull it out, damn it!

01:26:19.916 --> 01:26:21.333
Hey, Shankar Rao!

01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:22.625
Yes, sir.

01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:24.500
Bring me a dagger for this scum!

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:28.541
You guys screwed me
over in my own station!

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:32.250
Hurry up! How much time do you need?

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:35.458
Cut it.

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:38.000
Why are you hesitating? Cut it!

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:39.125
-Hey… Hey
-Okay, sir!

01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:42.958
-Chop it off! Hey! Hey…
-Are you all mad?

01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:44.833
Hey… Wait.

01:26:45.458 --> 01:26:46.958
Hold on, let me think.

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:51.708
Hey, Dheena…

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:56.000
If we cut one finger,
he'll flaunt the others.

01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:59.208
Let's do this instead.
Let's cut the whole hand off.

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:01.958
-Sure, Gambheera.
-Shankar Rao!

01:27:02.125 --> 01:27:03.291
-Sir?
-Chop his hand off.

01:27:03.375 --> 01:27:04.208
Hey…!

01:27:04.291 --> 01:27:05.708
-Chop the scumbag's hand!
-Okay, sir.

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:08.125
-Hey, Gawde, bring a bigger knife.
-Hey..

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:13.375
I will kill every one of you!

01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:16.333
Shankar Rao, how much time do you need?

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:19.166
-Two minutes, sir.
-Hurry up!

01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:24.541
You're saying two minutes
but it's taking forever! Hurry up!

01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:25.750
Hey, Gawde!

01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:33.958
Show me. What's this?

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:36.416
I wanted a big one. Not this!

01:27:37.833 --> 01:27:40.625
Damn it! I didn't ask for a Bofors gun!

01:27:40.833 --> 01:27:44.041
A rusted knife. Just one! Go find it!

01:27:47.583 --> 01:27:48.833
A single rusted knife!

01:27:48.916 --> 01:27:51.666
Not a single rusted knife
in this whole station, huh?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.708
-Go search, you idiot! Fast!
-Go and get one.

01:27:58.458 --> 01:27:59.583
Gawde…

01:28:01.958 --> 01:28:03.291
Gawde…

01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:09.583
Now, let me show you.

01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:12.083
Bloody fool, you can't do this! Move!

01:28:12.541 --> 01:28:13.916
Come on, stretch his hand out.

01:28:14.166 --> 01:28:15.875
Stretch his hand out! Properly!

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.208
Stretch it properly. One more inch.

01:28:18.291 --> 01:28:20.125
Hold it like this!

01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:22.791
-Bloody scumbag!
-Worli!

01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:25.708
Worli construction building.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.833
They hid everyone from the port there.

01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:30.500
Including Geetha.

01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:37.041
A deer can run 90 miles per hour.

01:28:38.083 --> 01:28:40.333
But a tiger can go
up to 60 miles per hour only.

01:28:42.125 --> 01:28:44.708
Yet the tiger brings down
the deer in a hunt.

01:28:45.541 --> 01:28:46.583
You know why?

01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:49.791
Fear.

01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:55.916
The deer gets caught due to its fear
of being killed by the tiger.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:28:59.333
Fear!

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:22.958
Run!

01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:17.625
What happened?

01:31:27.666 --> 01:31:28.708
-OG…
-Huh?

01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:31.375
OG… OG!

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.291
OG is here!

01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:47.833
-Hurry! Run!
-Where are you going?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Hey, run!

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:55.541
Get inside, all of you!
Let me deal with OG.

01:31:58.583 --> 01:31:59.625
Everyone get in!

01:32:25.625 --> 01:32:27.375
I’m here to save my people.

01:32:29.166 --> 01:32:31.291
Go get whoever you want to save you.

01:32:31.916 --> 01:32:33.666
Go. Go!

01:32:35.916 --> 01:32:36.958
Pick up the gun.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.000
Kill him!

01:33:34.125 --> 01:33:36.166
I thought you were here as our bodyguards.

01:33:36.375 --> 01:33:38.916
Yes. To save you from Gambheera.

01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:50.166
Gambheera.

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:08.333
I wanted to set him ablaze
at the murder scene.

01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:12.125
-But I couldn't find his head.
-No!

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:14.125
Wait, Omi! Wait!

01:34:15.833 --> 01:34:17.750
Your brother isn't here now
to tell you about me.

01:34:18.375 --> 01:34:21.250
You're not in a state
to listen to your father.

01:34:23.833 --> 01:34:25.125
That's why I am here.

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:28.083
You have time until the pyre turns to ash.

01:34:28.291 --> 01:34:29.583
Let it all go.

01:34:31.041 --> 01:34:32.500
Including the container.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.416
You dare give Omi a warning?

01:34:38.041 --> 01:34:40.791
This isn't a warning… but a verdict.

01:34:43.041 --> 01:34:44.291
OG's verdict!

01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:03.583
Hey, no!

01:35:14.666 --> 01:35:18.583
Gambheera killed my father
fifteen years ago

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.041
and left Bombay.

01:35:22.958 --> 01:35:26.250
That memory has stayed
with me since I was six years old.

01:35:26.375 --> 01:35:27.208
Arjun!

01:35:27.458 --> 01:35:28.958
A bullet in my father's head...

01:35:29.041 --> 01:35:29.875
K. CHAKRAVARTHY,
BIRTH: 23-10-1943, DEATH: 15-6-1978

01:35:30.166 --> 01:35:31.625
...and a gun in Gambheera's hand.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:39.708
I want to drag him to death with me.

01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:43.333
I learned Japan's history

01:35:44.041 --> 01:35:46.541
and about the bloodshed
in Bombay, all for him.

01:35:47.791 --> 01:35:50.000
Finally, the day has come!

01:35:50.458 --> 01:35:52.250
Gambheera is back in Bombay.

01:35:53.458 --> 01:35:55.291
I don't care why he has returned.

01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:59.208
But I'll be the reason for his death!

01:36:46.375 --> 01:36:49.416
If I ask you something,
will you do it without refusing?

01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:53.250
Listen!

01:36:54.458 --> 01:36:57.208
If anything happens to me in the future…

01:36:57.375 --> 01:36:58.958
What... Don't talk nonsense!

01:36:59.791 --> 01:37:01.083
I only meant "if"...

01:37:02.375 --> 01:37:04.791
Take our daughter
and return to your father.

01:37:05.833 --> 01:37:07.208
Promise me you'll do so.

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:09.416
I'm scared.

01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:12.375
Okay.

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:28.375
Gambheera!

01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:32.333
The CM is here to meet Dada.

01:37:47.041 --> 01:37:48.458
Hiding the container…

01:37:48.708 --> 01:37:50.166
The chaos at the port…

01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:53.166
Killing Jimmy…
When will all this stop?

01:37:53.458 --> 01:37:55.291
Leave this problem to me.

01:37:55.416 --> 01:37:59.250
Tell me where the container is
and I'll take care of the rest.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:03.333
It's better if you don't
interfere in this matter.

01:38:03.833 --> 01:38:04.916
We'll take care of it.

01:38:06.666 --> 01:38:09.208
You’ve come all this way.
Have some tea before you go.

01:38:12.125 --> 01:38:16.166
I’m no longer the Corporator
who bends to your orders.

01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:18.458
I'm the Chief Minister of this state.

01:38:19.791 --> 01:38:20.875
One call…

01:38:21.833 --> 01:38:24.541
One call to my men there

01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:27.291
and your port here will be ours.

01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:29.958
SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT

01:38:38.625 --> 01:38:40.208
Your worthless past…

01:38:40.416 --> 01:38:42.250
Have you forgotten
the incident from 15 years ago?

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.333
Gambheera!

01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:47.333
Have you forgotten about
the Mahankali Jatara at Malad?

01:38:57.333 --> 01:38:58.458
Hey!

01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:09.833
Our shirts turned red
for the sake of your white shirts.

01:39:34.666 --> 01:39:37.083
We killed hundreds
to get you into the assembly.

01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:38.666
You built your party office
on their graves.

01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:51.666
You knew there were
thousands of kilos of RDX at the port

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:54.375
and that Bombay was in danger.
Yet you stayed silent.

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:56.958
You must remain so from now on.

01:40:01.625 --> 01:40:02.708
No rule!

01:40:04.541 --> 01:40:05.583
No law!

01:40:07.291 --> 01:40:09.000
Only Gambheera's law!

01:41:21.125 --> 01:41:22.208
No! No!

01:41:22.791 --> 01:41:23.875
Tell me, you scumbag.

01:41:23.958 --> 01:41:24.958
-I'll tell you.
-Go on.

01:41:55.166 --> 01:41:56.708
A hundred people must've died.

01:41:58.208 --> 01:42:00.833
This bloodbath was
his deadly warning to Omi.

01:42:00.958 --> 01:42:04.000
What can he even do?
I'll inform David right away.

01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:08.500
It's some guy called OG.

01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:10.791
He killed all of Omi's men here.

01:42:11.166 --> 01:42:12.708
The container's also with him.

01:42:13.125 --> 01:42:14.750
Seems like our plan is off.

01:42:15.958 --> 01:42:18.000
Finish Omi, that scumbag.

01:42:18.416 --> 01:42:21.041
His death must be so terrifying

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:26.375
that people fear not just
breaking promises but even making them.

01:42:37.875 --> 01:42:41.541
You can search the port a hundred times.
But you’ll find nothing, I swear.

01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:44.916
I've combed the place inch by inch.
The container isn't there.

01:42:47.541 --> 01:42:50.666
That's an old map, Omi.

01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:52.625
Here, this is the new one.

01:42:58.208 --> 01:43:00.458
The new port map shows
two underground floors.

01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:02.125
The old map shows three.

01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:04.875
The RDX is right here, man!

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.791
Applause!

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.458
Finally, we know where the RDX is.

01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:35.083
But it's too late.

01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:37.708
You couldn’t do anything
when Gambheera wasn't here.

01:43:37.875 --> 01:43:39.333
And now he's back!

01:43:39.875 --> 01:43:41.625
What more can you accomplish?

01:43:47.958 --> 01:43:50.958
I'll teach you
how to get the work done.

01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:54.000
If you had had the guts
in the first place,

01:43:54.625 --> 01:43:56.500
David wouldn't have needed my help.

01:43:57.166 --> 01:44:00.500
However, I don't deal
with bootlickers like you.

01:44:01.916 --> 01:44:03.041
So, fuck off!

01:44:03.416 --> 01:44:04.875
-What did you say--
-Hey! Stop, stop!

01:44:05.041 --> 01:44:06.541
We gain nothing by fighting
amongst ourselves.

01:44:06.625 --> 01:44:08.666
-Let me talk. Let him go--
-Move!

01:44:10.791 --> 01:44:12.416
Omi is planning something big.

01:44:12.916 --> 01:44:16.208
Discarding the container
won’t stop the danger or Omi.

01:44:16.541 --> 01:44:18.041
Is he that powerful, Gambheera?

01:44:18.458 --> 01:44:20.291
You must have heard
of the great city of Waaji.

01:44:22.458 --> 01:44:25.458
Omi was the first to eye that city.

01:44:26.375 --> 01:44:28.625
Omkar Vardhaman Mirajkar!

01:44:29.041 --> 01:44:31.291
In the process of trying
to take over Waaji,

01:44:31.625 --> 01:44:33.875
he tried to kill Satya Dada's
younger brother, Roy Nandhan.

01:44:47.541 --> 01:44:49.791
From this moment on, my son…

01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:52.291
Saaho, is dead to the world.

01:45:02.166 --> 01:45:04.250
After that attack, he became
known as the man who scared Roy

01:45:04.333 --> 01:45:08.166
and rose through the ranks in the global
crime syndicate as an illegal arms dealer.

01:45:28.416 --> 01:45:31.375
But he never dared
to enter India… until now.

01:45:38.375 --> 01:45:40.625
If he's executing
such a massive plan now,

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:43.541
he must have a strong backer.

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:44.833
It's for you!

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.375
Say it!

01:45:49.666 --> 01:45:52.666
Co… Co… Cobra!

01:45:53.541 --> 01:45:54.750
He stays in Waaji.

01:46:09.166 --> 01:46:12.875
Omi, there's only one outcome
if you break your promise to David.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.250
Any last words?

01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:17.166
I was only supposed to deliver
the RDX container.

01:46:18.208 --> 01:46:19.833
But now, I won't stop there.

01:46:22.208 --> 01:46:23.875
Tomorrow, exactly at 9 p.m.

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:27.750
not one, but in nine places...

01:46:31.833 --> 01:46:34.125
Nine blasts, all at once!

01:46:39.458 --> 01:46:41.791
People will be out as usual,
wearing carefree smiles.

01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:45.791
And the stock market
will be ticking along as usual.

01:46:47.541 --> 01:46:50.500
But this day… will be different.

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:59.041
Bombay's flames will be so fierce,
its heat will reach you in Dubai.

01:47:01.708 --> 01:47:04.750
David is planning
such huge blasts in India…

01:47:05.208 --> 01:47:06.416
It's a statement.

01:47:07.583 --> 01:47:09.083
And tomorrow's the best day for it.

01:47:09.291 --> 01:47:10.916
How can you be so sure?

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.791
Because tomorrow is his birthday.

01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:23.666
I'll make sure that India
will always remember your birthday.

01:47:24.041 --> 01:47:25.333
It's my promise.

01:47:27.041 --> 01:47:28.666
Now this war is personal.

01:47:29.625 --> 01:47:30.666
Very personal!

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.791
Don't worry about the cost.
Give our people the best care.

01:47:36.916 --> 01:47:38.416
-This trust was created for them.
-Mom!

01:47:43.041 --> 01:47:44.125
-Look after them.
-Okay, madam.

01:47:45.208 --> 01:47:46.291
When did you get here?

01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:53.583
Though I was away from all of you…

01:47:55.625 --> 01:47:56.791
I didn't forget anyone.

01:48:00.541 --> 01:48:02.125
See my hand trembling?

01:48:07.583 --> 01:48:11.000
-But when I hold this gun… it stops.
-Arjun!

01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:14.041
But the trembling in here…

01:48:15.333 --> 01:48:17.458
-only ends with Gambheera's death!
-Arjun…

01:48:17.875 --> 01:48:20.916
That's why I went to him
before seeing you.

01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:33.000
I am Chakri's son…

01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:35.333
Didn't recognize me?

01:48:42.875 --> 01:48:44.708
Arjun! What have you done?

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:48.833
I went there to kill him.

01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:52.333
-But…
-Dad!

01:48:56.208 --> 01:48:58.041
A cheetah? You've drawn very well.

01:48:59.083 --> 01:49:01.000
Hi! What's your name?

01:49:01.375 --> 01:49:05.000
-Taara. And yours?
-Arjun. Come.

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:09.333
-Hey, Naga.
-Kadar.

01:49:09.875 --> 01:49:11.125
-Just a minute.
-Watch it.

01:49:11.416 --> 01:49:13.125
When the elders fight…

01:49:13.833 --> 01:49:16.708
it's kids like us who suffer the most.

01:49:18.666 --> 01:49:19.791
Shall we play?

01:49:22.333 --> 01:49:24.958
The reason I didn't kill
Gambheera all these days…

01:49:25.041 --> 01:49:26.708
-Taara!
-Have you seen the girl?

01:49:26.791 --> 01:49:28.125
-Taara!
-Have you seen the girl?

01:49:28.916 --> 01:49:31.583
...was to give him something
more painful than death.

01:49:39.291 --> 01:49:40.583
-Shut up!
-Dad!

01:49:42.125 --> 01:49:43.708
God has given me a chance now.

01:49:47.875 --> 01:49:50.333
The suffering you went through
when Dad passed away…

01:49:51.083 --> 01:49:52.541
that man must feel it now.

01:49:59.416 --> 01:50:00.875
Hey, don't cry! Shut up!

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:08.000
Hey, go faster!

01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:12.000
He must run madly
through the streets of Bombay,

01:50:12.291 --> 01:50:14.916
frantically searching for his daughter.

01:50:15.958 --> 01:50:18.000
-Dad! Dad!
-I told you to sit quietly!

01:50:29.916 --> 01:50:32.208
After running around…

01:50:38.125 --> 01:50:39.916
-…when he's tired…
-Hey!

01:50:40.291 --> 01:50:42.333
Hey! What the hell did you do?

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.041
Dad…

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.875
Hey, Arjun! Stop!

01:51:24.583 --> 01:51:26.333
Dad, please wake up!

01:51:32.125 --> 01:51:33.083
Dad…

01:51:34.291 --> 01:51:35.333
Dad…

01:51:35.416 --> 01:51:37.625
You killed my father right in front of me!

01:51:38.041 --> 01:51:41.333
I'll kill you in front of your daughter.

01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:46.583
Your death will stay with Taara
for the rest of her life.

01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:49.000
Arjun!

01:51:50.583 --> 01:51:52.833
-Hey!
-I've been waiting...

01:51:52.916 --> 01:51:54.875
-Dad…
-...for this day for so long.

01:52:00.041 --> 01:52:02.583
We work for Omi, not for you.

01:52:02.666 --> 01:52:04.000
Ten times more pay…

01:52:05.291 --> 01:52:06.625
Hey… take the girl away!

01:52:10.208 --> 01:52:11.500
Brother, come fast… Hurry!

01:52:14.083 --> 01:52:16.250
-Hey, start the car!
-Move it! Fast!

01:52:23.250 --> 01:52:25.458
Gambheera… Gambheera!

01:52:47.083 --> 01:52:48.208
Mom!

01:54:01.541 --> 01:54:03.083
Sir, our money?

01:54:03.166 --> 01:54:05.500
-How much?
-Ten each.

01:56:19.708 --> 01:56:21.500
He swore he'd save the port and Bombay.

01:56:21.625 --> 01:56:23.166
But he couldn't even save himself.

01:56:23.458 --> 01:56:25.125
How dare he challenge Omi!

01:56:25.291 --> 01:56:27.375
-Finish him off!
-Hey, Omi!

01:56:27.625 --> 01:56:30.458
Why do you need Gambheera? Just untie me.

01:56:32.166 --> 01:56:33.916
We’ll see who survives, you or me.

01:56:35.666 --> 01:56:37.791
If only Gambheera was here…

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.541
Hey! Uncle…

01:56:43.958 --> 01:56:44.958
Gambheera!

01:56:47.125 --> 01:56:49.166
You're sheltering a man
who murdered your son.

01:56:49.666 --> 01:56:51.208
Hey, Arjun! What's with the gun?

01:56:51.416 --> 01:56:53.375
-Where did you hide him?
-Arjun. Listen to me.

01:56:53.583 --> 01:56:55.291
-Arjun. Listen to me, Arjun!
-Hey!

01:56:55.708 --> 01:56:56.625
Hey!

01:56:58.958 --> 01:57:00.583
I must kill him today at any cost.

01:57:01.041 --> 01:57:02.250
If you get in my way…

01:57:03.708 --> 01:57:05.500
-I don't mind killing you, too.
-Arjun!

01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:11.666
If I'd known you'd turn out like this,

01:57:12.083 --> 01:57:14.333
-I wouldn't have hidden the truth.
-Geetha.

01:57:14.875 --> 01:57:16.875
No, Dada. It's already too late.

01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:20.833
Gambheera's suffering
so much because of him!

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.375
-He killed my dad.
-What do you even know about your dad?

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.333
Your dad used to import drugs
to the port behind Dada's back.

01:57:32.166 --> 01:57:36.500
He held a grudge ever since
Gambheera burned the stash.

01:57:41.416 --> 01:57:44.875
I thought he'd change,
but he turned out worse.

01:57:45.083 --> 01:57:47.416
We can't lay a hand on Gambheera

01:57:47.875 --> 01:57:50.833
since he has your father's support.

01:57:51.166 --> 01:57:52.583
What if my dad is out of the picture?

01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:56.166
He kidnapped his own dad
to take control of the port.

01:57:56.541 --> 01:57:59.541
Gambheera saved both you and Dada.

01:58:04.166 --> 01:58:07.958
Dada threw Chakri out of the port
once he found out.

01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:10.416
Driven by that anger…

01:58:11.916 --> 01:58:15.541
-Chakri, why are you taking the gun?
-To end them both!

01:58:15.875 --> 01:58:19.208
-Whoever I see first, dies first!
-Chakri? Chakri!

01:58:19.291 --> 01:58:21.125
-No, Chakri! Please!
-Geetha! Get out of my way.

01:58:21.208 --> 01:58:23.291
-I'm talking to you! Geetha!
-Chakri! Give me the gun.

01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:24.583
Geetha, give me the gun!

01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:29.916
No… Chakri, listen to me.

01:58:31.083 --> 01:58:33.083
Please listen to me, Chakri…

01:58:33.166 --> 01:58:35.958
-Your worry is making me suspicious.
-What are you doing?

01:58:36.041 --> 01:58:38.125
-Chakri…
-Let go of the gun!

01:58:38.208 --> 01:58:40.250
-Let it go! Hey!
-Leave it!

01:58:42.166 --> 01:58:44.416
Geetha! Geetha! Hey!

01:58:45.875 --> 01:58:47.833
Geetha, open the door!

01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:49.541
Hey, Geetha!

01:58:49.666 --> 01:58:51.791
Geetha, open the door! Geetha!

01:58:53.208 --> 01:58:55.500
Hey! I'm talking to you!
Open the door!

01:58:56.416 --> 01:58:57.375
Geetha.

01:58:58.666 --> 01:58:59.750
-Arjun!
-Yeah?

01:59:00.541 --> 01:59:02.291
Come here. Bring me
the keys from the cupboard.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.750
Dad, there are no keys. Only a gun.

01:59:13.083 --> 01:59:14.250
A gun? Bring it here.

01:59:15.416 --> 01:59:17.916
-Hello? Gambheera?
-What's wrong?

01:59:18.250 --> 01:59:19.583
Come home this instant!

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.291
Climb! Climb! Quickly!

01:59:28.416 --> 01:59:29.458
Give me the gun. Give it!

01:59:29.583 --> 01:59:31.625
-Just like that. A little higher.
-Dad, I can't reach you.

01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:33.791
Just a little higher.

01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.416
-A little higher.
-Arjun?

01:59:40.041 --> 01:59:41.083
Give it to me.

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:44.041
Mom!

01:59:44.916 --> 01:59:46.041
Arjun!

01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:50.875
What happened?

02:00:04.958 --> 02:00:07.666
Arjun should never know the truth.

02:00:09.458 --> 02:00:11.166
I'll take care. Don't worry.

02:00:15.166 --> 02:00:16.458
Get out of here.

02:00:29.333 --> 02:00:32.166
You believed what you saw was real.

02:00:32.541 --> 02:00:35.708
Your dad made the mistake.
You fired the gun.

02:00:35.958 --> 02:00:38.416
But Gambheera took the blame.

02:00:54.291 --> 02:00:55.833
I realized later…

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:59.708
that not everything we see is real.

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:02.500
Should we…

02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:04.791
bring him back?

02:01:05.583 --> 02:01:07.875
There's only one thing
we can do for him now.

02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:11.541
Let’s let him live in peace.

02:01:19.666 --> 02:01:21.083
What… have I done!

02:01:25.125 --> 02:01:26.583
So, the one who needs to die…

02:01:27.166 --> 02:01:30.500
is not Dada… or Gambheera…

02:01:36.375 --> 02:01:38.750
-It's me.
-Hey! Arjun!

02:01:40.208 --> 02:01:41.625
What are you doing, Arjun?

02:01:43.791 --> 02:01:45.791
Gambheera made me promise
to keep the truth hidden

02:01:46.125 --> 02:01:48.125
to spare you from self-hatred.

02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:58.666
He did all this… for our family.

02:02:30.958 --> 02:02:32.416
I know where he is.

02:02:33.916 --> 02:02:34.916
I need to go.

02:02:35.458 --> 02:02:36.916
Use it correctly now.

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:39.166
Go.

02:02:40.625 --> 02:02:41.958
-Arjun!
-Geetha.

02:02:44.541 --> 02:02:45.958
The war has begun!

02:02:47.541 --> 02:02:48.583
We can't stop it.

02:03:42.708 --> 02:03:45.416
-Hello?
-I've placed bombs in nine spots.

02:03:48.291 --> 02:03:51.125
And I've set them
to detonate at 9 o'clock on the dot.

02:03:53.291 --> 02:03:54.833
Just like I promised

02:03:55.083 --> 02:03:57.291
there will be
a party today… and a blast.

02:03:57.708 --> 02:04:01.583
Thank you, Omi.
This is the best birthday gift.

02:04:01.875 --> 02:04:06.083
As a return gift, I'll make you
the top arms dealer in the Middle East.

02:04:06.833 --> 02:04:07.958
Enjoy the show!

02:04:10.166 --> 02:04:13.750
Sir, Yukimura Shinzou
from Japan is here to meet you.

02:04:18.458 --> 02:04:20.750
Yukimura Shinzou…

02:04:20.958 --> 02:04:22.666
He used to be a Yakuza leader.

02:04:23.041 --> 02:04:25.583
Once upon a time,
he ruled the international syndicate.

02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:27.791
What does he need from me?

02:04:28.083 --> 02:04:29.333
Excuse me, sir.

02:04:30.250 --> 02:04:33.541
Sir, these weapons
are not allowed inside.

02:04:35.416 --> 02:04:36.916
Do you have any problem, sir?

02:04:40.083 --> 02:04:41.875
Sir, weapons are not allowed inside.

02:05:20.708 --> 02:05:23.833
So, tell me. What brings you here?

02:05:24.125 --> 02:05:28.333
Mr. David, I've come
to offer you my friendship.

02:05:30.625 --> 02:05:34.125
Mr. Shinzou, my trust in friendship

02:05:34.333 --> 02:05:37.375
died with the men
that I buried to get here.

02:05:39.083 --> 02:05:40.291
OG!

02:05:42.708 --> 02:05:44.083
How do I say this?

02:05:44.541 --> 02:05:47.916
The Bombay gangster you hired

02:05:48.375 --> 02:05:50.541
has no clue about OG.

02:05:50.958 --> 02:05:51.833
OG?

02:05:52.208 --> 02:05:53.541
OG is history!

02:05:53.791 --> 02:05:54.875
History?

02:06:04.041 --> 02:06:06.833
OG… erases history!

02:06:11.083 --> 02:06:14.416
Death doesn’t come easily
for some people…

02:06:14.541 --> 02:06:16.541
even when they long for it.

02:06:23.916 --> 02:06:26.333
Every time he faces death,

02:06:26.875 --> 02:06:29.875
death itself takes a step back in fear.

02:06:35.125 --> 02:06:38.250
Every drop of blood he spills

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:41.250
only intensifies the fear.

02:07:04.708 --> 02:07:06.458
Not interested!

02:07:06.875 --> 02:07:10.500
Excuse me. I have a fire show to attend.

02:07:12.875 --> 02:07:17.375
You please finish your drink
and leave at your convenience.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.541
I can't believe your father, OG, is dead.

02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:34.416
Is your father dead, honey?

02:07:56.666 --> 02:07:57.958
-Go over there!
-Come on!

02:08:45.708 --> 02:08:46.833
Here comes the hero!

02:08:48.291 --> 02:08:49.625
Now the real fun begins!

02:08:49.708 --> 02:08:51.583
Not fun, you fool…

02:08:54.208 --> 02:08:55.250
It's death!

02:09:03.291 --> 02:09:04.958
Death's here for you…

02:09:11.875 --> 02:09:13.458
...in the form of Gambheera!

02:09:19.666 --> 02:09:21.833
I'll welcome my death with your blood.

02:09:25.208 --> 02:09:26.500
-Untie them.
-Okay.

02:10:49.666 --> 02:10:51.041
Hey!

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:41.458
-Which floor?
-Sir, 37th.

02:11:41.791 --> 02:11:43.875
There are only bodies
on the 37th floor, man!

02:11:44.083 --> 02:11:46.083
He's probably on the 39th, sir.
We're going to the 39th.

02:11:46.166 --> 02:11:47.125
39…

02:11:47.291 --> 02:11:49.458
The guns we got
from the port are all there.

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:07.208
This is an ambush. Johnny…

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.541
Come on!

02:13:32.333 --> 02:13:33.250
Hand it over!

02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:43.500
Hey! Shoot me. Shoot me!

02:13:44.166 --> 02:13:46.208
Shoot me! Shoot me!

02:13:46.333 --> 02:13:48.916
Hey, Omi! Where are you?
Come out, you idiot!

02:13:49.041 --> 02:13:51.083
-Come out!
-OG!

02:13:51.208 --> 02:13:52.791
-Omi!
-If Omi comes out, you’ll die.

02:13:52.958 --> 02:13:56.541
It's Gambheera! Ojas Gambheera!

02:13:57.041 --> 02:13:59.916
If you truly love Taara,
drop your weapon

02:14:01.416 --> 02:14:04.291
kneel down like a good father

02:14:05.583 --> 02:14:07.916
and beg for your daughter's life.

02:14:08.083 --> 02:14:09.666
Dad! Dad!

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:11.083
-Taara!
-Dad!

02:14:12.083 --> 02:14:15.000
-Taara! Taara!
-Dad!

02:14:15.375 --> 02:14:17.250
-Dad!
-Gambheera!

02:14:17.416 --> 02:14:20.333
Your daughter is with us.
Drop the gun.

02:14:20.833 --> 02:14:22.416
You don't have any other option!

02:14:28.166 --> 02:14:30.750
You know why I called you here?

02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:38.000
My entire life has been
a constant battle for the port.

02:14:38.416 --> 02:14:40.500
It's reached Bombay now!

02:14:41.125 --> 02:14:44.708
Back then,
I did not have anyone by my side.

02:14:46.625 --> 02:14:47.916
But right now,

02:14:48.541 --> 02:14:50.916
I have my son, Omi, with me.

02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:55.166
Wow, Gambheera! Wow!

02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:01.625
Where's my daughter?

02:15:02.083 --> 02:15:03.958
Before you hear about your daughter…

02:15:05.083 --> 02:15:07.375
let me tell you
how her mother died… No, no.

02:15:10.166 --> 02:15:12.083
I mean, who killed her…

02:15:13.125 --> 02:15:14.166
Don't you want to know?

02:15:16.791 --> 02:15:18.791
Jimmy wasn’t the only one
at the hospital that day.

02:15:19.666 --> 02:15:20.500
I was there too.

02:15:23.958 --> 02:15:25.416
-Pathan!
-Yes, boss.

02:15:25.541 --> 02:15:27.750
Hold a knife
to the old man’s throat and call me!

02:15:27.833 --> 02:15:29.583
-Catch him!
-Understood, boss.

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:35.916
Ma'am! Please escape. Please leave.

02:15:36.791 --> 02:15:37.791
Jimmy!

02:15:40.583 --> 02:15:41.500
Catch him!

02:15:42.375 --> 02:15:44.333
Jimmy, the boss wants us
to chase them. Hurry!

02:15:51.833 --> 02:15:53.666
-How did he escape?
-Because of her!

02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:54.833
You useless fools!

02:15:54.958 --> 02:15:57.125
-You couldn't catch an old man!
-Gambheera…

02:16:02.791 --> 02:16:04.250
Gambheera…

02:16:04.791 --> 02:16:06.458
Gambheera will come…

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.375
He'll come and kill you--

02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:30.541
You should've brought her to me

02:16:32.583 --> 02:16:34.000
before you killed her.

02:16:34.583 --> 02:16:35.583
Hey!

02:17:23.416 --> 02:17:25.958
Where is my daughter? Where is she?

02:17:27.041 --> 02:17:28.166
Where is she?!

02:17:29.041 --> 02:17:30.208
Where is my daughter?!

02:17:36.083 --> 02:17:37.166
Where is my daughter?

02:17:37.291 --> 02:17:39.000
Do you want to talk to your daughter?

02:17:39.458 --> 02:17:40.541
Where's my daughter?

02:17:40.875 --> 02:17:42.958
-You want to talk to her, right?
-Where is she?

02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:44.791
Do you want to talk to her?

02:17:47.291 --> 02:17:48.125
Tawde!

02:17:49.041 --> 02:17:51.041
-Yes, Omi. Tell me.
-Where's the girl?

02:17:51.208 --> 02:17:52.333
She's right here.

02:17:54.875 --> 02:17:56.625
Dad! Dad!

02:17:56.958 --> 02:17:58.625
-Where are you, Dad?
-Let… let me speak.

02:17:58.791 --> 02:18:00.083
-I'm scared, Dad!
-Give it to me.

02:18:00.291 --> 02:18:01.791
-Finish her.
-Dad!

02:18:03.125 --> 02:18:04.250
Dad.

02:18:04.791 --> 02:18:07.083
-Dad! Dad!
-Taara… Taara!

02:18:07.291 --> 02:18:09.500
-Dad!
-Taara, my dear!

02:18:11.666 --> 02:18:12.833
Taara...

02:18:15.291 --> 02:18:16.208
Taa…

02:18:21.625 --> 02:18:22.500
No.

02:18:24.833 --> 02:18:26.000
No, no, no!

02:18:27.791 --> 02:18:29.208
You mustn't die just yet.

02:18:30.833 --> 02:18:33.458
In a few moments, the entire city
of Bombay will be up in flames.

02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:35.666
You must see that with your own eyes.

02:18:36.958 --> 02:18:38.083
No more Bombay…

02:18:39.458 --> 02:18:40.541
And no more OG.

02:18:43.791 --> 02:18:44.750
Three…

02:18:48.333 --> 02:18:49.291
Two…

02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:52.750
One…

02:18:53.708 --> 02:18:54.750
Boom!

02:19:11.333 --> 02:19:13.375
What is happening? Huh?!

02:19:14.583 --> 02:19:16.875
-What happened?
-Don't you get it?

02:19:20.416 --> 02:19:22.291
-Dad.
-Taara!

02:19:22.625 --> 02:19:24.166
-Dad!
-Taara!

02:19:24.416 --> 02:19:25.583
Taara is safe.

02:19:31.916 --> 02:19:35.458
Gambheera, put Omi down like a dog.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.541
Remind the world who OG is!

02:19:51.291 --> 02:19:53.958
Eagle, O Eagle…

02:19:54.583 --> 02:19:56.875
Eagle, O Eagle!

02:19:57.291 --> 02:19:59.583
Eagle, O Eagle!

02:19:59.875 --> 02:20:02.208
Eagle, O Eagle!

02:20:02.916 --> 02:20:05.583
Eagle, O Eagle!

02:20:14.125 --> 02:20:16.291
Eagle, O Eagle!

02:20:18.125 --> 02:20:23.125
To kill a wild Eagle...

02:20:24.208 --> 02:20:29.000
The first thing you need to cut...

02:20:30.958 --> 02:20:32.416
...is its wings!

02:20:35.291 --> 02:20:36.750
When it falls to the ground,

02:20:38.875 --> 02:20:40.500
you pluck out its eyes!

02:20:41.958 --> 02:20:46.625
Then it becomes… blind.

02:20:48.208 --> 02:20:52.875
It wouldn't know where to go.

02:20:54.666 --> 02:20:56.291
That’s when…

02:20:57.958 --> 02:20:59.791
You cut its legs

02:21:04.291 --> 02:21:06.000
and make it immobile!

02:21:07.833 --> 02:21:12.000
And that's when…
you pluck its wild heart out!

02:21:14.916 --> 02:21:16.958
Eagle, O Eagle…

02:21:21.250 --> 02:21:23.541
Eagle, O Eagle…

02:21:28.833 --> 02:21:31.250
Eagle, O Eagle!

02:21:44.791 --> 02:21:46.833
I knew you'd be back.

02:21:53.791 --> 02:21:54.916
My friend.

02:22:07.333 --> 02:22:09.791
Your son might be
the ten-headed demon, Ravana.

02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:29.333
But my Gambheera…

02:22:40.625 --> 02:22:43.083
He's a hero capable
of assuming ten divine forms!

02:22:46.125 --> 02:22:47.958
You've only seen two of them.

02:22:49.375 --> 02:22:51.083
Do you know what the final one is?

02:22:53.291 --> 02:22:54.583
The Kalki avatar!

02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.958
All that’s left now…
is the slaying of Ravana.

02:22:59.791 --> 02:23:00.750
Go!

02:23:27.916 --> 02:23:30.708
I’ll come back for my revenge, OG!

02:23:50.333 --> 02:23:51.375
Who is he?

02:24:11.291 --> 02:24:13.125
Orochi Genshin!

02:24:16.416 --> 02:24:17.791
We thought he was dead.

02:24:37.625 --> 02:24:40.208
He annihilated the Yakuza.

02:25:19.083 --> 02:25:22.708
He beheaded my son, Kazao!

02:25:30.666 --> 02:25:33.250
Our army won't be enough.

02:25:35.166 --> 02:25:39.000
He is… the original gangster!

02:29:58.291 --> 02:30:00.333
The storm in Bombay blew over.

02:30:01.041 --> 02:30:05.208
No one knows about the hero
who saved the city.

02:30:06.083 --> 02:30:09.541
Like you, I thought this story ended here.

02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:13.291
But the story has just begun.

02:30:14.791 --> 02:30:17.208
-Dad!
-Come here. Come to dad.

02:30:21.208 --> 02:30:22.958
Arjun… Thank you.

02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:25.708
Take care of Bombay.

02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:29.541
-Gambheera!
-Yeah?

02:30:30.041 --> 02:30:31.083
Will you come back?

02:30:32.375 --> 02:30:33.500
Only if it's necessary.

02:30:41.208 --> 02:30:43.791
Dad, what is OG?

02:30:45.041 --> 02:30:46.083
OG?

02:30:47.166 --> 02:30:48.791
How do I explain?

02:30:49.458 --> 02:30:51.250
It's a long, long story.

02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:53.708
Taara, do you know
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose?

02:30:53.833 --> 02:30:55.041
I don't know.

02:30:55.208 --> 02:30:57.291
-Azad Hind Fauj?
-No.

02:30:57.541 --> 02:31:00.541
How do I explain when you know nothing,
yet demand to know everything?
