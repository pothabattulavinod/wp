00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000


00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:46.541
The container from India
is packed with red sandalwood.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.000
Let the boss know.

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.000
{\an8}Hello.

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.916
{\an8}We found red sandalwood in a container.

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.833
{\an8}We have no clue who sent it.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:57.541
Yes, boss.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.583
How did red sandalwood reach the port
without our permission?

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.000
We're not sure how.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.708
Check the name of the shipping company.

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:27.708
{\an8}BASHBV.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:32.166
- BASHBV?
- That's right, sir.

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:36.916
You have to see this.

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:39.083
There's a coolie inside the container.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.083
Seems like an Indian.

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:43.125
An Indian coolie…

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:47.041
survived 40 days in that container
without food or water?

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:49.625
Who could it be?

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.500
Find out.

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:52.916
Okay, boss.

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:11.666
{\an8}Hang him upside down.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.500
Who are you?

00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:34.375
And who sent this load?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.666
He's not answering.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:40.416
Bring in someone
who can speak his language.

00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:43.666
Hello, boss.

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.500
He's from India.

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:48.625
Find out who he is.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.916
Ask him who he brought this load for.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.041
I'll ask him, boss.

00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:57.041
Hey! Who the hell are you?

00:04:57.125 --> 00:05:00.166
Telugu or Tamil?
He's asking where you got that load from.

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.083
There's no reply.
That means he's a Telugu guy.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:07.708
There's no reply.
That means he's a Telugu guy.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.458
- Oh, my!
- Ask him properly.

00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:13.916
Hey! Why aren't you saying anything?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.208
Who are you?

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:16.833
Who the hell are you?

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.041
Pushpa!

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.916
Finish him off!

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.208
Yes!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.916
Ready?

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:48.750
Hello!

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.250
How are you,
my Japanese brothers?

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:53.916
Are you doing well?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.041
For many days,
I wondered what the country

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.208
receiving my goods would be like.

00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:02.500
Today, I finally found out.

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:20.625
The weather here is cold.

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.291
Really cool! Cool!

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:24.291
{\an8}Japanese!

00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:27.000
{\an8}Hey! Do you speak Japanese?

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:29.916
Of course!

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.208
Instead of sitting idle
in the container for 40 days,

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:40.208
{\an8}I learned Japanese in 30.

00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:43.500
How is my Japanese?

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.750
How is my Japanese?

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:48.708
{\an8}Superb! Superb!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.958
So, what brings you to Japan?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.833
The wood has made it to Japan, but…

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:07.375
the money still hasn't
made its way to Tirupati.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:12.666
I'm here to show what happens
when you mess with Indians.

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:20.916
My shoes are Japanese
Not sure what's the next line

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:27.708
I have a red Russian hat on my head

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:34.041
I have a red Russian hat on my head

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.041
Still…

00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.208
Still…

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:49.375
Still, my heart is Indian

00:08:57.291 --> 00:08:58.875
Coming here is his mistake.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.166
Letting him go alive will be our mistake.

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:07.125
Show him the Japanese hospitality.

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:22.333
Scoundrel!

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.625
Aren't you the one who stole my money?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.083
{\an8}Hey, Pushpa!
Why lock horns with these people?

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:36.958
Did you come all this way for money,
only to end up losing your life?

00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:38.166
Hey…

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:43.583
Every penny owed to me,

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.625
{\an8}whether beyond the seven hills
or across the seven seas,

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.416
Pushpa always makes sure it comes back.

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:53.083
How does your country look upside down?

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:54.958
Show me where the money is.

00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:58.041
If you don't tell me,
your boss won't spare you.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.000
My boss… Hiroshi.

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:04.125
Hiroshi's boss.

00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:06.791
Hiroshi's boss? Who?

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.625
You can see your boss normally.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:16.875
But when you're upside down,
you'll see the boss of your boss.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.541
I'm your boss!

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.208
I'm your boss!

00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:35.625
Pushpa, the boss!

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:38.375
Pushpa is your real boss!

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.833
No matter where I am on this earth,

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:44.750
I never back down.

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.041
Wherever I am,

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:47.916
I won't back down.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.666
{\an8}Get the ball, dude.

00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:58.708
- Hey, he can't swim.
- I'll make him bring it.

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:01.291
- What's your name?
- Mulleti Pushpa Raj.

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:03.541
- And your dad's name?
- Mulleti Venkataramana.

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:06.000
But the villagers say otherwise.

00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:08.875
No, brother. He is my dad.
My mom said so.

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.500
Hey! Does anyone here believe him?

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:12.916
{\an8}No, brother!

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.583
Do one thing.

00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:18.583
{\an8}Fetch that ball,

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:21.625
{\an8}and we'll all believe that
your dad is, in fact, Venkataramana.

00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:02.250
Hey, he's drowning!

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:03.500
Run!

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:17.208
Dear…

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.916
what do you want?

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:21.583
Hey…

00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.625
What's wrong, dear?
Did you have a nightmare?

00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.041
What's more nightmarish than the truth?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.750
Hey, Srinu! Why are you coming to work
with your wedding just two days away?

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:09.000
Are you thinking straight?

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:11.708
Getting married isn't a big deal.
I can go after seeing the load off.

00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:15.166
But if we don't send the stock on time,
won't it tarnish Pushpa's reputation?

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:17.041
Your father-in-law
is a crazy guy, as it is.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.083
If he finds out you're here,
he'll raise hell!

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:21.125
Let him.
Pushpa is more important to me.

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:24.416
We're already short of men.
And Pushpa had to hire new ones.

00:15:24.541 --> 00:15:27.500
You're right, bro. We're the regulars.
How can we not go?

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:30.958
Hey, Srinu. What are you getting
for the wedding? A bicycle?

00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.291
Not just a bicycle.
They gifted me a ring as well.

00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:38.375
- Let the person in front go first.
- Make it quick!

00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:39.583
Faster!

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.250
Move it. Faster.

00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:45.125
Get in! Get in!

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:48.791
- Get in!
- Fast!

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:56.166
Hey! The goats are loaded!

00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:59.750
Looks like it's going to rain.
Let's start right away.

00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:06.166
Move it!
You're sitting on my lap!

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:10.166
I'm talking to you!
You're sitting on my lap! Move it!

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:13.041
Hey, Gajendra.
He probably doesn't know about you.

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:14.583
Looks like a new guy.

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:17.416
What's up, man?
Why do you look clueless?

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.000
Are you scared of the cops?

00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:22.750
Don't worry, dude.
Pushpa will take care of everything.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.166
See that mark on the lorry?
That's Pushpa's brand.

00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:27.666
It's like a national permit.

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:29.541
With that mark,
no police officer dares to stop us.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.291
Yeah, man.
What happened to that bald cop?

00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:34.000
I heard he hasn't been
showing up for duty lately.

00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:37.583
- Who? That Shikhamath?
- Not Shikhamath. It's Shekhawat.

00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:38.625
How will he show up?

00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:40.583
Pushpa stripped him
and thrashed him.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.708
He must be terrified.

00:16:43.916 --> 00:16:46.625
Unable to show his face,
he might be hiding in disguise.

00:16:56.708 --> 00:16:59.333
- Just goats, sir.
- Yes. Goats, sir.

00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:07.666
{\an8}Where are we going now?

00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:15.416
{\an8}Hold this carriage.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.500
Careful, it's slippery.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.750
Hey, new guy. Watch your step.
It's slippery.

00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:34.625
Hey, careful!

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.500
{\an8}Put out that fire and follow us.

00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:53.458
Hey, new guy!
Bring that toddy pot for the ritual.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.583
Swami, Pushpa's family is here.

00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:53.708
The crown looks magnificent, ma'am.

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.166
The diamond studding shows
that it's not locally made.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.375
- Yes. It is--
- Enough happiness, sir.

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:02.500
Looks like hard work.
Perform archana on their gotra and name.

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:11.125
Please tell us your gotra.

00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:15.208
Ask her the surname, and you'll
automatically know the gotra.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:18.791
Yes, dear. Just tell me your surname,
and I'll let you know your gotra.

00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:23.041
You need a surname
to figure out your gotra.

00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:27.708
The priest is new around here.
So he wouldn't know.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958
The surname is Mulleti,
the gotra is Paidipalli.

00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:31.708
He didn't ask our gotra.

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:35.458
He's asking for the gotra of those
who brought that big crown.

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:41.541
Swami, does God have a surname?

00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:46.208
All names are His, child.
What surname could He possibly have?

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:49.416
My husband is the same.
Just like God.

00:19:50.291 --> 00:19:52.000
Perform the archana
in the name of God.

00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:53.166
Alright, dear.

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:57.750
Bringing a golden crown isn't enough.

00:19:58.458 --> 00:19:59.958
You should also be eligible for puja.

00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:03.958
- I pity them, Mohan.
- Don't take Dad's words to heart, Auntie.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.166
{\an8}Nagappa!

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:38.250
{\an8}- Forty-two kilograms.
- Forty-two kilograms, bro!

00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:40.666
- Keep it fast.
- Seethapathi.

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:43.458
{\an8}- Fifty kilograms.
- Seethapathi, fifty kilograms.

00:20:43.541 --> 00:20:44.541
{\an8}- Move it.
- Gajendra.

00:20:47.458 --> 00:20:49.750
- Seethapathi, take the money.
- Gajendra, 56 kilograms. Move it.

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.208
- The new guy.
- Come on here.

00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:53.458
- Keep it fast.
- Hey, hurry up!

00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:55.583
- How much is it?
- Thirty-six kilograms.

00:20:55.666 --> 00:20:56.708
New guy, thirty-six kilograms!

00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:58.625
- Come here.
- What's your name, man?

00:20:58.708 --> 00:21:00.708
- Tighten it a bit, don't want it to slip.
- Shekhawat.

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:06.875
Hey! What did you say your name is?

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.666
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat!

00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:21.166
- Mr. Kupparaju. You may come now.
- Sir.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.208
Everyone is holding the logs.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.833
- They aren't escaping. Come on.
- Okay, sir.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.791
Hey, eat up.
You have ten more minutes.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.041
Eat!

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:33.708
Hey!

00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:35.375
Bald police, right?

00:21:37.291 --> 00:21:38.416
Bald police?

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:40.166
Bald police!

00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:44.333
Shekhawat!
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat!

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.916
Attack!

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:53.833
{\an8}Catch them!

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.333
Oh, no! Run that way!

00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:08.833
Don't leave any of them!
Cover the entire area!

00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:22.916
He has gone to the forest for Pushpa
despite his wedding.

00:22:23.416 --> 00:22:24.875
What happened now?

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.500
Instead of being at his own wedding,
he's sitting in the police station now!

00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:31.208
He's not coming anyway.

00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:33.333
- Hey, call my nephew.
- Yes, Uncle.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.250
Wear a pancha and tie the knot.

00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:36.166
- Okay, Uncle.
- Dad!

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.291
There's still time for the muhurtham.
He'll come and tie the knot.

00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:42.500
- I have faith in him.
- Hey, crazy lady! Don't you understand?

00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:45.875
To him, Pushpa became more
important than marrying you.

00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:49.083
Don't blame him, Dad.
It was me who asked him to go to work.

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:50.916
Pushpa! Pushpa! Pushpa!

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:53.666
Do you really think
Pushpa will come to rescue this coolie?

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.833
- Greetings, Pushpa!
- Greetings, brother!

00:23:39.916 --> 00:23:41.000
- What's up, guys?
- Greetings, Pushpa!

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.958
What brings you here, Pushpa?

00:23:49.458 --> 00:23:51.791
Won't I come if you lock up my boys?

00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:59.750
Srinu is getting married in an hour.
I'm here to take him.

00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:02.041
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:06.458
- Take those keys and bring him out.
- Okay.

00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:07.625
What? Srinu?

00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:09.166
- What are you saying, Pushpa?
- Wait.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.333
An FIR has been registered in his name.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.833
Total of 230 people.

00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:14.958
The count will be off
if even one is missing.

00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:16.375
Is it?

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:20.125
Hey. Do we have a Srinivas among us?

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:22.500
- Hey, Srinivasulu. Where are you?
- Here, brother.

00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:25.500
- My name is Srinu as well.
- Have you eaten?

00:24:25.583 --> 00:24:27.416
- No, boss.
- I had my meal, boss.

00:24:27.583 --> 00:24:30.375
- Then go inside and bring him out.
- Okay, boss.

00:24:30.458 --> 00:24:31.916
Sir, that's D. Srinivas
and this is B. Srinivas.

00:24:32.083 --> 00:24:34.375
Hey, wait up!
What is this, Pushpa?

00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:37.000
That guy is D. Srinivas
and this guy is B. Srinivas.

00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:38.916
How can we manage this?

00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:41.333
What's the difference?

00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:45.083
Put another "D" under that "D,"
and you'll have a "B."

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.000
Can't you guys change
one letter for me?

00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:52.416
{\an8}It's not like that, Pushpa.
Shekhawat sir is very strict.

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.333
- Hey.
- It's not like before.

00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:57.500
- Where did you get this betel chew?
- From the same place. Why?

00:24:57.583 --> 00:24:59.125
It's biting me back.

00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:01.541
What was the CI saying?

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.708
Pushpa, I said, it's not like before
and the rules have changed.

00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.500
So, the rules have changed?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.416
It seems the rules
have changed for the CI.

00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:21.958
{\an8}- What's sir's salary like?
- Around 10,000 rupees.

00:25:23.708 --> 00:25:27.000
How much did sir give as dowry
at his daughter's wedding?

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:31.000
- We pitched in 500,000, macha.
- 500,000 rupees as dowry?

00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:32.000
Yes!

00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.958
What rule let you give that?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.500
What rule, I ask!

00:25:47.958 --> 00:25:48.833
And here.

00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:54.375
An ordinary constable Venkatadri's son
is studying engineering.

00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:56.541
- With a donation of 100,000 and--
- 200,000 rupees, macha.

00:25:57.541 --> 00:25:59.208
Under what rule did you give that?

00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:05.041
Your wife bought a pearl necklace
from Prodduturi Padma Jewelers.

00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:08.875
What about that rule?
Did it change or stay the same?

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.750
Did you watch the cricket match
last night, Mr. Shetty?

00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:19.458
Did you watch Tendulkar in color?

00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:22.166
- What TV is it?
- Samsung Flatron, macha.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.916
He owns the same TV as the SP.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.833
What about the rule that purchased the TV?

00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:31.333
Should I tell you…

00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:33.000
what that rule is?

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:38.625
Bhakarapeta, Mangalampeta, Talakona,
Pinchalakona, Thalakadakona.

00:26:38.875 --> 00:26:43.375
What I'm about to say will echo across
the Tirupati hills. So, listen up!

00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:47.583
Whatever happens here, it happens
according to just one rule.

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:51.083
Do you know what rule that is?

00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:00.208
Pushpa's rule!

00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:13.958
Chinni Krishna.
What do you think you're doing?

00:27:14.458 --> 00:27:15.375
Chinni Krishna!

00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:18.666
Srinu, come out.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.041
It's time for the muhurtham.

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:23.708
- Change your clothes fast.
- You get in there.

00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:24.666
Greetings, boss.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.166
Not here.
Go to CI's bathroom. It's cleaner.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.833
Hey! Come here.

00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:31.583
What's that bruise on your arm?

00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:34.000
Nothing, boss.

00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:36.875
Did these guys thrash you?

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.750
Pushpa's brand is like a national permit.

00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:12.583
This is my brand!

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.375
This is my brand.

00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:19.166
This is my brand, sir!

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:23.000
He was able to draw blood from our bodies…

00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:27.708
but he couldn't make us reveal your name.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.750
Look at this mark.

00:28:45.666 --> 00:28:48.500
This is formed from carrying the logs.

00:28:49.583 --> 00:28:53.916
Everyone with this mark
is like a partner to Pushpa.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.333
If a single blow lands on them,

00:28:58.708 --> 00:29:00.750
it's like Pushpa is hit.

00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:03.333
I can't stand it.

00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:06.708
CI Ponnaiah is an expert
in the third degree.

00:29:07.708 --> 00:29:09.916
{\an8}He must have gotten them
to reveal Pushpa's name by now.

00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.500
All we need to do is
arrest him in the morning.

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:21.708
Hey! Why is the station empty?

00:29:24.416 --> 00:29:25.333
Where are all the cops?

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:32.458
Where are the coolies?

00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:34.166
Where is everybody?!

00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:35.958
Hey!

00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:40.125
Where did everyone go?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.125
Pushpa came here after you left, sir.

00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:45.666
We acted on the orders
of Shekhawat sir, Pushpa.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.875
What could we do?

00:29:48.208 --> 00:29:49.166
I'm taking them away.

00:29:50.041 --> 00:29:51.458
Not just Srinu.

00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:53.291
I'm taking away everyone.

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:55.666
- Hey, Kesava. Bring everyone out.
- Pushpa, what is this?

00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:57.000
Hey, Pushpa. Wait.

00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.541
We'll lose our jobs, Pushpa.

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.041
What did you say?

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:05.666
- We'll lose our jobs.
- Jobs?

00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:07.166
Hey…

00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:10.083
it seems their jobs are on the line.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.791
What did you say…

00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:13.750
the CI's salary is?

00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:15.916
Ten thousand, Pushpa.

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:19.333
{\an8}- What's your salary?
- 4,300.

00:30:19.416 --> 00:30:21.125
- Bribes?
- I receive around 30,000.

00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:23.666
- And your service?
- Got another 18 years left.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.750
- And the pension?
- Around 1.5 million.

00:30:25.833 --> 00:30:28.916
- Total?
- 3,408,800.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.375
Chinni Krishna.
Round figure, 4.2 million.

00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.166
- Venkatadri, what's your salary?
- 4,100.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.666
{\an8}- And bribes?
- 18,000.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.291
- How many years of service are left?
- Three years.

00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:38.625
{\an8}- And the pension?
- One million.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.208
- 3,305,600.
- Varaprasad, round figure, four million.

00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.166
Next.

00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:47.583
Oh my!
The CI has joined too, macha.

00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:49.958
The rules have changed, dude.

00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:51.458
Hand him the cash and send him.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:54.708
With so much money,
why wouldn't the rule change?

00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:55.791
Now, it's only your rule.

00:30:58.166 --> 00:30:59.250
Who is the second glass for?

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.083
It's for Shekhawat sir.

00:31:01.333 --> 00:31:02.958
He has asked for a party, right?

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.625
What if everyone has left, sir?

00:31:11.083 --> 00:31:12.833
There will be one at every station.

00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:15.791
A sincere one like him.
Let's include him in the promotion list.

00:31:15.875 --> 00:31:18.416
Sir, I have also received
the offer from Pushpa.

00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:22.208
I was here to hand over these keys
and the resignation letters.

00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:23.708
I'll take your leave, sir.

00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:31.916
Everyone has resigned.

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:33.791
Damn it.

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:36.125
We should've arrived
ten minutes earlier.

00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:39.958
If you had, you would have
walked away with an offer too.

00:31:41.125 --> 00:31:44.000
Then, I would have been left alone.

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:46.750
Just like a complete fool!

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.541
I slogged away, cutting logs

00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:56.958
and capturing the thugs,

00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:00.500
but he swooped in like an eagle
and took them all away.

00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:03.208
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.916
{\an8}He beat me so badly…

00:32:07.958 --> 00:32:10.208
{\an8}that even when I just think of "Pushpa,"

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:12.708
{\an8}it echoes out loud.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.625
{\an8}Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:17.833 --> 00:32:20.958
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:24.208
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:27.416
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.583
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:33.791
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:37.666
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:38.541 --> 00:32:39.916
Pushpa!

00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:42.958
{\an8}Pushpa!

00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:46.375
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:32:46.458 --> 00:32:49.375
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:32:49.458 --> 00:32:52.750
When you brush your beard
The country trembles

00:32:52.833 --> 00:32:55.666
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.041
When you raise your shoulder and walk
The ground itself shatters

00:32:59.125 --> 00:33:02.000
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:33:02.083 --> 00:33:05.416
For you to stand straight
Even the sky needs to be raised

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.250
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:11.708
To measure your height
The sea must be dug deeper

00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:14.833
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:23.416
If you cower like a sparrow in the rain
It's your fault if defeat is your chain

00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:27.416
But like a mighty eagle
When you soar past every limit

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.541
Even rain bows to you
Pouring at your feet

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:33.791
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:36.916
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.083
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:43.291
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:46.500
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.208
I like this one, brother.

00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:49.541
- It looks good.
- Hey, Pushpa!

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:53.666
Your niece bought herself a chain.
She said that you'd cover the cost.

00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.958
What do we do now?

00:33:57.333 --> 00:33:59.166
Got it.
We pay for it.

00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:01.625
WELCOME

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Pushpa knows many things
But not all!

00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:17.625
Fear? Defeat?
Never heard that call

00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:20.666
No stepping back, no pause in stride
Just relentless pride

00:34:21.375 --> 00:34:24.458
Pushpa has it all
But not everything

00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:27.000
{\an8}No fear, no regrets

00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:30.416
No fright, no rival in his way
And he'll never back down

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.916
He bows only to God
Salutes only the mentors

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.208
Kneels only before the mother

00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:40.250
Why wait for another to see your value?
Why wait till others know the real you?

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:43.375
With fire in your veins and pride
Your name alone is your own brand

00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:46.166
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Pushpa!

00:34:46.583 --> 00:34:48.583
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:51.791
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa!

00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:56.041
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:34:56.125 --> 00:34:59.250
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:02.375
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:05.541
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:08.666
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.000
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa
Pushpa, Pushpa, Pushpa Raj!

00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:20.958
{\an8}Chief minister KVV Narasimha Reddy's
Tirupati tour is live on your screens…

00:35:21.041 --> 00:35:22.958
{\an8}Hey, the CM reached the guest house.

00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:25.541
Party workers and local leaders
are welcoming him in large numbers…

00:35:25.625 --> 00:35:29.250
Hey! You can have breakfast later.
It's time, the boss is coming.

00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:32.375
Hey, I'm leaving.

00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:34.916
What a wonder!
Sir is charming today!

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.541
Heading to meet the CM?

00:35:39.791 --> 00:35:41.250
Are you also wearing perfume?

00:35:41.708 --> 00:35:44.458
- Wow!
- The perfume isn't for the CM.

00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:47.208
It's for my wife.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.083
That's alright, dear.

00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:52.833
Take one picture with the CM.

00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:56.458
I'll make a grand display of it
in our hall.

00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:58.166
What for?

00:35:58.708 --> 00:36:03.208
So, I can boast that my husband
has meetings with the CM.

00:36:05.416 --> 00:36:08.208
It's just a photo.
I'll get it for sure.

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:12.791
Why just a photo?
I can do anything for my wife.

00:36:13.708 --> 00:36:17.333
Dear! Don't touch me like that.
I get those feelings.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.791
- Isn't that good for health?
- Dear!

00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:21.916
Don't, dear!

00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:25.708
If I get the feelings,
you'll be in trouble.

00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:28.083
- What kind of trouble?
- No, dear!

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.000
Not so loud.
The boys might hear.

00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.750
And my pride will go for a toss.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.125
No, dear!
Please stop.

00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:41.833
Hey!

00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:45.000
- Where are you going?
- To the meeting.

00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:50.291
- Come, dear.
- Where to?

00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:51.875
I got the feelings.

00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:55.458
Is this a joke?
I've got a meeting with the CM.

00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:59.958
You should have thought about this
before kissing me.

00:37:00.416 --> 00:37:03.750
Hey, you!
My shirt's going to get wrinkled!

00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:05.958
I'll take care of that, dear.

00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:08.125
It'll show, dear! Hey…

00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:11.583
- Hey, Kesava!
- Yes, macha?

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:13.750
Your vadina didn't like
this shirt I'm wearing.

00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:15.708
- I'll change and join you.
- Hey! Come on!

00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:17.750
Okay, macha.

00:37:18.125 --> 00:37:19.958
Guys, now you can have breakfast.

00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:22.375
- Sister! Please bring the plates.
- Right away.

00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:24.583
Hello?

00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:28.000
Yes, brother. Boss will take
another 30 minutes to arrive.

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:29.833
Please inform Mr. Siddappa.

00:37:29.958 --> 00:37:32.375
Didn't I tell you that
the shirt wouldn't get wrinkled?

00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:35.666
Yes, dear.
It's just like a flower.

00:37:36.208 --> 00:37:38.916
- You are just amazing!
- Dear!

00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:40.958
I'll get feelings again.

00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:42.625
What? Again!

00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:46.291
I'm getting late.
Hey! Is this a joke?

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.833
- Kesava!
- Macha.

00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:51.583
Are we running late?

00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:55.500
I already told them
we'd arrive after 30 minutes.

00:37:55.875 --> 00:37:58.958
This shirt is better
than the other one, macha.

00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:01.208
You've been getting
too full of yourself, man.

00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:03.291
- Why, macha?
- You know it's the same shirt.

00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:04.916
And yet, you speak like that.

00:38:05.708 --> 00:38:07.208
Is it really the same shirt, macha?

00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:10.500
I thought that was a different shirt
because it didn't have this sticker.

00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.958
Stop the act, dude!

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:18.666
{\an8}Pushpa! Pushpa! Pushpa!

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.083
Pushpa! Pushpa! Pushpa!

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.625
What brings you here, Pushpa?

00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:26.416
Are you going
to the assembly from Seshachalam?

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.208
By morning, all the legislators
are heading to Pushpa's house.

00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:32.500
Why would Pushpa need to go
to the assembly?

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.708
Nothing like that.

00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:36.958
My wife never asks for anything.

00:38:37.041 --> 00:38:40.541
But today, she wants me
to take a picture with the CM.

00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:43.125
I'm here to fulfill her wish.

00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:46.708
- Are you eyeing the state from the center?
- Are you aiming for a cabinet ministry?

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:50.791
- Nothing like that! No rumors, please!
- Please tell us, sir.

00:38:50.875 --> 00:38:53.958
So, are you seeking the ministry or not?

00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.833
Isn't that why I'm here?

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:59.416
The word has already spread across.
Shouldn't I ask at least now?

00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:03.375
I'm also planning to ask
for Shekhawat's transfer.

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.875
Don't do any such thing.

00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:08.125
It'll look like we're afraid of him.

00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:09.750
You're nowhere involved in this.

00:39:09.833 --> 00:39:12.250
He's my problem,
and I'm dealing with it. Okay?

00:39:12.458 --> 00:39:15.541
You'll tell him, that's alright.
But what will he think?

00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:18.583
He'll think I'm behind all this.
Won't that be an insult to me?

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:22.958
Sir, forget him
and focus on your ministry.

00:39:23.041 --> 00:39:25.875
- But that--
- Plan such things behind my back.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.416
If I find out, I'll oppose it.
Now that I know, drop it.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.333
Brother.

00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:35.083
What's this, Shankar Reddy?
We couldn't win ten wards in Chittoor.

00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:36.083
Greetings, brother!

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:39.750
- What makes your brother…
- Let's stand here.

00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:41.041
Come here.

00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:42.041
Why's that?

00:39:43.208 --> 00:39:45.416
Your feet are on the ground
only when you stand.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.541
One leg rests on the other knee
when you sit down.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.416
It doesn't look good in front of the CM.

00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:55.916
My legs are carrying Pushpa, right?
So, they have a certain pride.

00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:59.250
Come, Siddappa.
What's going on?

00:39:59.666 --> 00:40:01.083
Nothing that you don't know of.

00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:05.875
How's Pratap Reddy?
Tirupati streets are full of his photos.

00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:07.708
Is this my trip or his?

00:40:07.916 --> 00:40:09.250
He's the state in charge…

00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:11.958
Is the shirt good enough
for a photo?

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.291
It's looking good, macha.
Just like it's been changed.

00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:18.250
- I need to tell you about this guy.
- Yeah!

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:21.083
Pushpa, right?
I keep hearing your name.

00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:23.916
A lot of people
speak about you these days.

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.375
What a man you are!

00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:28.458
We heard that you
emptied the police station

00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:30.708
and gave the cops their retirement.

00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:33.666
Your sound isn't just spreading here.

00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:36.416
It's resounding even in Delhi.

00:40:36.916 --> 00:40:40.375
You bring in a lot of funds
for our party. We're happy with it.

00:40:40.666 --> 00:40:42.666
You're free to do as you wish.
What say, Siddappa?

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.916
Pushpa's wife asked for
a good photograph with the CM.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.916
Hey!

00:40:48.708 --> 00:40:50.000
What's this, Siddappa?

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:51.625
What, brother?

00:40:51.958 --> 00:40:55.291
A photo with these smugglers isn't
as easy as them giving us party funds.

00:40:57.541 --> 00:41:01.416
Shoes are meant for the feet,
not the hands, right?

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.041
If this photo gets published
tomorrow-- Hey!

00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:08.166
Hey! Did you take a picture?

00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:11.041
- I didn't, sir.
- But I heard the "click."

00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:13.041
Mr. CS.

00:41:13.291 --> 00:41:16.166
- Did you hear the "click"?
- There wasn't any flash, sir.

00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:18.333
Not the flash, but the sound.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.541
Mr. Surender.
Did you hear the "click" sound?

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:23.500
Yes, sir. I doubt it too.

00:41:23.583 --> 00:41:25.583
- If we print it--
- That's what we need to avoid!

00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:27.125
- Give it to him.
- Fast!

00:41:30.708 --> 00:41:33.708
This morning, you clicked photos
of my wife and kids on the hill.

00:41:33.916 --> 00:41:35.916
- Are those pictures also in this?
- Yes, sir.

00:41:36.083 --> 00:41:37.375
Idiot!

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:39.791
You ruined everything!

00:41:44.041 --> 00:41:49.375
Siddappa, the boy listened to his wife
and showed up here for the photo.

00:41:51.625 --> 00:41:56.458
Pushpa, no one who obeys his wife
has ever prospered.

00:41:57.083 --> 00:41:58.083
Keep that in mind.

00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:00.458
Come, Siddappa.

00:42:01.833 --> 00:42:03.125
Did you want to talk about something?

00:42:07.666 --> 00:42:10.750
Sit. You wanted to say something, right?
What is it?

00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:13.875
- Good morning, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:16.666
- Greetings, sir.
- What is it?

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.458
Your style is unmatched!

00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:20.541
Shut up, man.
It's not like that.

00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:22.458
I was worried
he'd be upset about all that.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:24.041
But he's alright.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.208
What's up, sir?
Is your work done?

00:42:29.791 --> 00:42:30.791
Yes, man.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.750
Not sure about the portfolio
but he confirmed my ministry.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.166
We need to arrange the cash.

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:40.625
No. I want to know
if Shekhawat's transfer is done.

00:42:41.166 --> 00:42:42.166
You asked me not to mention it.

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:44.875
But you did ask.

00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:47.916
He said it wasn't possible.

00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:50.125
He said it wouldn't be possible if,

00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:53.208
instead of cooperating with the police,
you pick fights with everyone

00:42:53.416 --> 00:42:54.416
and then demand their transfer.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.125
You weren't interested either,
so I let it go.

00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:59.416
Him refusing is one thing,

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.750
and my refusal is another.

00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:04.625
There's a lot of difference.

00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:05.666
What's this?

00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:07.666
Changing your tone?

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:11.458
Calling the CM names
just because he didn't give you a picture?

00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:13.583
Nothing like that.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:18.083
The CM has a million issues

00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:20.750
to pose for a picture
with a smuggler like me.

00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:23.875
You'd do the same
if you became the CM tomorrow.

00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:26.500
Why would I do that?
I'd pose for a picture with you.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.041
- Really? You'd give me a picture?
- Yes, man. Why not?

00:43:33.416 --> 00:43:34.625
Then you are the CM.

00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:40.083
- What's that?
- I said that you are the CM.

00:43:41.625 --> 00:43:42.541
Me? CM?

00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:44.958
What is this, Pushpa?

00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:46.083
Are you out of your senses?

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.125
CM?

00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:50.166
CM!

00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:52.458
Anyway…

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.250
why chase after silly posts when
someone like Pushpa is by your side?

00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:01.083
The ministry and whatnot!

00:44:02.375 --> 00:44:04.416
Why can't you aim higher, sir?

00:44:05.666 --> 00:44:09.125
If there was a Pushpa beside me,
I'd think the same.

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:15.375
One can surely think, but…

00:44:16.125 --> 00:44:19.125
a CM's post would cost a lot.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
How much would it be?

00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:31.416
A minimum of… one billion.

00:44:41.416 --> 00:44:44.041
Would five billion be enough?

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:50.625
Where will you bring that much money?

00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:57.000
Leave the money matters to Pushpa…

00:44:57.875 --> 00:45:00.125
and meet Pratap Reddy in Delhi.

00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:04.958
Stand up.

00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:07.166
Hey! Give me the shawl.

00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:14.458
- Hey! Take our picture.
- Sure, brother.

00:45:19.833 --> 00:45:24.041
Get that picture developed
and keep it safe.

00:45:24.625 --> 00:45:26.791
Give it to your vadina
once he becomes the CM.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.875
Sir…

00:45:31.666 --> 00:45:34.125
you wanted to know if I felt bad.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.958
I did.

00:45:38.958 --> 00:45:40.583
But not because
he refused to take a picture.

00:45:41.875 --> 00:45:44.541
I felt bad because
he spoke about my wife.

00:45:46.375 --> 00:45:47.333
Sir…

00:45:48.291 --> 00:45:50.166
Srivalli is my wife.

00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:53.375
I'll listen only to her.

00:45:54.833 --> 00:45:56.833
I'll do what she suggests.

00:45:58.083 --> 00:46:01.125
I'll show the world what it is like…

00:46:03.666 --> 00:46:05.208
to listen to the wife.

00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:08.958
No matter what it takes,

00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:11.750
in matters like this,

00:46:12.916 --> 00:46:14.791
everyone knows that

00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:16.708
I never…

00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:20.000
Hey, boy!

00:46:20.083 --> 00:46:21.083
Brother.

00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:26.791
I too heard the "click" sound.

00:46:28.583 --> 00:46:29.625
Mr. Minister,

00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:33.416
this guy lied to the CM for us.

00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:38.750
He'll be your photographer
once you become the CM.

00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:43.083
- Take a photo then, with a "click."
- Yes, brother.

00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:54.666
- Hey, Srivalli. Your husband's on TV.
- Really?

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.375
- Long live…
- Pushpa!

00:46:56.458 --> 00:46:59.125
- Long live…
- Pushpa!

00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:02.416
- Pushpa, what happened in there?
- Pushpa, did you get a photo with the CM?

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.458
The CM is pretty busy today.

00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:08.416
{\an8}He said he'd be coming
to my house for the photo.

00:47:09.333 --> 00:47:11.041
{\an8}The CM said he'd come to our house

00:47:11.833 --> 00:47:13.958
{\an8}on July 24th for lunch.

00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:18.958
I'm wondering whether to cook
lamb or goat that day.

00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:22.166
- What's special about the date 24th?
- Am I hearing my son's voice on TV?

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.666
Yes, it's your son.

00:47:25.208 --> 00:47:26.750
It seems the CM promised
to visit our home.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.958
- But why?
- What do you mean why?

00:47:29.041 --> 00:47:31.916
Do you think
your son is an ordinary person?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.750
He asked for a photo at my insistence.

00:47:33.916 --> 00:47:37.541
So he's visiting our home for the photo.
That's what your son is capable of.

00:47:38.208 --> 00:47:42.791
I'll invite everyone from Tirupati
for a meal that day, Auntie.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.875
What do you say?

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.416
Sure, Srivalli.

00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.875
{\an8}LORD BALAJI'S OFFERING

00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:12.458
Drink up, Siddappa.
There's more.

00:48:12.916 --> 00:48:15.666
Brother, is this why I'm here?

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.625
A job like the CM's isn't suited for you.
Forget about it.

00:48:20.166 --> 00:48:21.083
Why, brother?

00:48:22.291 --> 00:48:24.833
I've been loyal to the party for 20 years.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.375
I've been pitching in with funds
whenever required.

00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:31.083
What qualifications does Narasimha Reddy
have to be the CM? What am I lacking?

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:34.958
Do you think I'm unfit to be the CM?

00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:39.000
I've known you for years, Siddappa.

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:41.041
This is not you.

00:48:42.541 --> 00:48:43.666
These aren't your words.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.541
Who's behind you?

00:48:57.625 --> 00:48:58.875
Your brother Subba Reddy
is on the line.

00:49:00.666 --> 00:49:01.625
Yes?

00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:03.833
Someone here has something to do with you.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.250
He brought in fifty million rupees.

00:49:09.458 --> 00:49:10.750
{\an8}What do I do, brother?

00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:13.041
{\an8}Fifty million? Who'd that be?

00:49:23.916 --> 00:49:25.166
Greetings, brother.

00:49:25.625 --> 00:49:27.125
My name is Pushpa.

00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:31.458
People in the market call me
red sandalwood Pushpa.

00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:33.750
Yes. I know you, man.

00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:36.458
You're Konda Reddy's
quarter partner, right?

00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:38.458
I've been hearing about you.

00:49:39.458 --> 00:49:42.333
If you think you are speaking
to a quarter partner,

00:49:44.083 --> 00:49:48.041
I'll have to speak to a clerk
who counts lorries in the quarry.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.333
Why dig our own histories?

00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:57.708
So what's with the fifty million?

00:49:58.791 --> 00:50:02.666
That isn't for you, brother.
It's for your sibling.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.666
Because he brought you on the line.

00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:11.041
How long will you sit
in the same chair?

00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:14.541
I'm sending you a new sofa.

00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:17.041
Make yourself comfortable in it.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.708
It's no ordinary sofa, brother.

00:50:30.416 --> 00:50:32.375
It's pretty costly.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.333
It's a sofa worth 250 million.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.416
What tender is this for?

00:50:39.875 --> 00:50:41.166
Quarry or mining?

00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:43.416
Which part of the state
do you need it in?

00:50:46.208 --> 00:50:48.291
I want the entire state.

00:50:50.166 --> 00:50:52.625
I want Siddappa
to become the CM of the state.

00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:59.083
Do you think your decision alone matters?

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.708
It will, brother.

00:51:01.833 --> 00:51:04.833
Pushpa's decision
is like the Tirupati laddoo.

00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:08.875
Once out, it cannot be returned.

00:51:09.416 --> 00:51:11.291
Feel blessed and accept it.

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.958
Siddappa will become the CM for sure.

00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:17.500
I started with you.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.750
If not…

00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:23.416
I've got many more sofas, brother.

00:51:35.708 --> 00:51:37.041
Who is this, Siddappa?

00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:42.416
He doesn't care about money
and has no fear of power.

00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:46.333
He carries a hidden sorrow within him.

00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:50.166
He'll put anything at stake for it.

00:51:51.083 --> 00:51:52.083
Sir.

00:51:56.125 --> 00:51:58.500
Deal with him carefully, Siddappa.

00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:02.208
{\an8}What's this, man?

00:52:02.291 --> 00:52:05.000
{\an8}Fifty million for a phone call
and 250 for the dealer?

00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:09.625
If you distribute the syndicate money
like grains, who'd be answerable tomorrow?

00:52:09.708 --> 00:52:12.166
The members of the syndicate
will receive their share as always, sir.

00:52:12.958 --> 00:52:15.291
But the amount received by the syndicate
is what's going to change.

00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:16.708
It's the same ton and the same 15 million.

00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:17.791
How'd the amount change?

00:52:17.875 --> 00:52:21.041
If we sell to Mangalam Srinu,
the price will be five million per ton.

00:52:21.833 --> 00:52:25.541
When Srinu goes to Murugan,
the price goes up to 15 million.

00:52:26.333 --> 00:52:29.125
What if we directly reach out
to Murugan's buyer?

00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:33.708
Your vision seems to have stopped
at the state border, sir.

00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:37.958
But Pushpa's vision has
crossed the country's border.

00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:43.833
What? Did you think Pushpa is national?

00:52:47.166 --> 00:52:49.166
International!

00:53:08.458 --> 00:53:10.666
- Isn't the party here yet?
- They are.

00:53:11.833 --> 00:53:13.000
- Where are they?
- Over there.

00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:20.958
- What is he doing?
- He's offering prayers to his God.

00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:22.750
It's called Shiv mala.

00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:26.333
- Did they come in this tempo?
- Yes, bhai. This one.

00:53:27.708 --> 00:53:30.083
Well, even my dog
wouldn't ride in this tempo.

00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:32.041
Sorry.

00:53:34.125 --> 00:53:36.583
You've brought a bunch of nobodies.

00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:38.166
Didn't you inquire beforehand?

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.500
Bhai, they've come
all the way to the Maldives.

00:53:40.583 --> 00:53:42.041
Just have a brief meeting with them.

00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:43.958
Quickly now, get to the point.

00:53:45.416 --> 00:53:47.833
It should be a deal of
at least ten billion.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.708
All these small-scale deals
of 100 to 200 tons…

00:53:52.166 --> 00:53:54.541
If I called anyone in India,
they'd send it right away.

00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:55.875
Please make the call, Shiva.

00:53:57.333 --> 00:54:00.833
Not 100 tons, but ask for ten.

00:54:03.958 --> 00:54:07.541
You think nobody in India
would give me ten tons?

00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:10.166
I know all the players of India.

00:54:14.333 --> 00:54:15.958
- Hello?
- Murugan.

00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:17.000
Yes, bhai.

00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:18.333
How are you?

00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:21.166
I'm doing great. Tell me.

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.791
I need ten tons of the stuff, urgently.

00:54:23.875 --> 00:54:24.750
Ten tons?

00:54:24.833 --> 00:54:26.791
That's right. I need ten tons.

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:29.666
- It's urgent.
- Right. Give me a minute.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:37.875
Shiva. Murugan Shiva.

00:54:40.833 --> 00:54:42.333
Greetings, Murugan Shiva.

00:54:43.083 --> 00:54:45.375
Pushpa. I need ten tons.

00:54:49.208 --> 00:54:51.916
I'm in a meeting.
I'll call you back.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.166
Mr. Aggarwal, how have you been?

00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:59.166
I'm good, bhai.
What's going on?

00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.333
I need ten tons of the stuff.

00:55:01.416 --> 00:55:02.625
Alright, bhai.

00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:10.208
- Greetings, Aggarwal Shiva.
- Greetings, Pushpa bhai.

00:55:11.083 --> 00:55:12.625
I need ten tons.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.875
Brother, I need ten tons immediately.

00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:24.958
I understand that it's urgent.
I'll give you a contact number.

00:55:25.041 --> 00:55:25.916
Alright.

00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:28.666
9-4-4-3-4…

00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:31.666
Hey, is this Pushpa's number?

00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:33.458
Do you know Pushpa?

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.416
I'm just getting to know him.

00:55:42.833 --> 00:55:45.333
Pushpa. That's a simple name.

00:55:47.083 --> 00:55:50.958
The name is small,
but the sound is huge.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.208
Now that you like the sound,

00:55:58.041 --> 00:55:59.750
let's talk business, Shiva.

00:56:00.708 --> 00:56:01.625
How much?

00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:04.708
Two thousand tons.

00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:08.000
The cost of a ton?

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.875
Twenty-five million.

00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:12.458
Are you kidding me, Pushpa?

00:56:13.666 --> 00:56:16.333
The business is no joke for Pushpa.

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.875
Business with Pushpa…

00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:22.833
is extremely fun.

00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:27.958
Two thousand.

00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:36.666
Two thousand tons.

00:56:38.041 --> 00:56:39.166
Fifty billion.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.375
Take it.

00:56:42.666 --> 00:56:44.791
Forty-nine billion.

00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:48.250
Why reduce it by one billion?

00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:50.791
Don't you have sufficient supply?

00:56:51.291 --> 00:56:53.000
For the remaining one billion…

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.708
Excellent!

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.958
It won't be long before he meets his end.

00:57:19.416 --> 00:57:20.708
How will we go now?

00:57:20.958 --> 00:57:22.708
Bhai, you'll have to ride in this tempo.

00:57:22.833 --> 00:57:26.250
Like I said,
even my dog wouldn't ride in it.

00:57:26.833 --> 00:57:27.708
Hey!

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:30.166
Open that.

00:57:31.083 --> 00:57:32.000
Please come, ma'am.

00:57:32.958 --> 00:57:37.583
Macha Shiva. We're in a helicopter now.
Place your leg over your knee.

00:57:38.916 --> 00:57:39.833
Shiva.

00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:42.208
When we're down,

00:57:42.833 --> 00:57:45.583
we have to cross our legs
over our knees to show that we're on top.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:50.708
Now that we're already on top, there's
no need to cross our leg over the knee.

00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:54.208
When we are at the top,

00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:56.625
we shouldn't go for ego, Shiva.

00:57:57.458 --> 00:57:58.875
We need to back down a little.

00:57:59.333 --> 00:58:02.875
Shiva. Call our syndicate members
and ask for the stock.

00:58:04.708 --> 00:58:05.875
Two thousand tons?

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Two thousand tons?

00:58:09.125 --> 00:58:10.125
Two thousand tons?

00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:12.416
Yes, Shiva.

00:58:13.708 --> 00:58:16.583
Hey, are you out of your senses?

00:58:16.916 --> 00:58:17.958
Dastagiri Shiva.

00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:22.416
- Dastagiri Shiva.
- How will you bring that many laborers?

00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:24.333
- Shiva.
- Yes, Shiva.

00:58:24.416 --> 00:58:28.416
- What are we paying our laborers?
- Two thousand, Shiva.

00:58:30.416 --> 00:58:32.166
From now on, the coolies will earn…

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.500
Ten thousand gig, Ten thousand gig!

00:58:34.583 --> 00:58:36.458
Now, they'll flock like crazy.

00:58:36.541 --> 00:58:38.583
Ten thousand gig, Ten thousand gig!

00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:41.416
{\an8}Ten thousand gig.

00:58:42.166 --> 00:58:45.541
{\an8}Do you have any idea how many lorries
we'd require to transport that much stock?

00:58:45.625 --> 00:58:49.125
- They are quoting one million per lorry.
- Buy as many as you can, Shiva.

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.875
- Okay, boss.
- Also…

00:58:50.958 --> 00:58:54.208
purchase the drivers
and the cleaners along with the lorries.

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.416
Shambo Shankara!

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.708
- I need 200 tons from you this time.
- Sure, boss.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.791
- You have to send 200 tons.
- I'll send 100, boss.

00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:06.291
Shambo Shankara!

00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:08.791
- How much are you sending?
- I'll send 100 tons.

00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:13.416
- I'll send 50 tons.
- I'll send 150 tons, boss.

00:59:14.875 --> 00:59:16.041
I'll send 70 tons, boss.

00:59:17.791 --> 00:59:20.041
- I'll give 90 tons.
- Count me in for 150 tons.

00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:21.250
I can deliver 100 tons.

00:59:21.333 --> 00:59:23.375
One hundred is mine,
and one hundred is his.

00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:25.500
Shambo Shankara!

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.833
You asked him for 100 tons
and want just 50 tons from me?

00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:33.083
Do you think I'm a loser?
What's this, Pushpa?

00:59:33.333 --> 00:59:36.041
Hey, Bicha Reddy.
That is Mangalam Srinu's area, man.

00:59:36.125 --> 00:59:38.541
Procuring the stock is easy.
But bringing it across isn't.

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:40.208
No matter who tries to stop me,

00:59:40.666 --> 00:59:44.083
- I'll bring the stock.
- But there are many police check posts.

00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:46.625
It's a big risk.
Why don't you listen?

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.041
Hey…

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.583
he's eager to bring it.

00:59:51.333 --> 00:59:52.833
Why stop him?

00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:55.166
Bicha Reddy.

00:59:55.583 --> 00:59:56.458
Go ahead, man.

00:59:57.625 --> 00:59:58.583
What's up, Pushpa?

00:59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.833
Why are you moving
so much stock all of a sudden?

01:00:00.916 --> 01:00:04.291
We need to know too, right?
Why you're doing all this?

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.041
See that wall over there?

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:08.541
We need to set up a big photo frame there.

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:13.000
- What? These many tons just for a photo?
- Dear, I'm cooking lamb curry.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.333
Please taste it.

01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:17.875
That Shekhawat
is already on the prowl for us.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:21.666
Is this huge exercise
necessary at such a time?

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:25.541
Pushpa doesn't think
if something is correct or not.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.625
He takes a decision…

01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:31.541
and it proves to be correct.

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.125
It's salty, dear.

01:00:42.916 --> 01:00:44.833
- Hey, bring some water.
- Macha.

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:48.416
You may be Pushpa,

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:52.083
but you can't tell your lady
that the curry is salty.

01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:53.583
It's a pity he doesn't know that.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:57.791
Macha, Srivalli vadina is angry.
She's throwing away all the curry.

01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:00.583
- But why?
- Because you said it's bad.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.250
Will she throw it away just for this?

01:01:04.541 --> 01:01:08.041
- Can't I tell her it's salty?
- You can, macha.

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:12.125
What's this salty mess
in the middle of such a big meeting?

01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:17.125
I'll be right back.
A family matter came up.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.041
Hey, Srivalli!

01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:21.916
Hey, look!

01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:24.916
- Hey, Srivalli.
- What?

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:30.416
What's up, dear?
Why are you so angry?

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.250
Why do you think I am?
You criticize everything I cook!

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:36.041
Have you ever appreciated my cooking?

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:39.375
I made it out of so much love
because it's your favorite!

01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:46.041
I was following a ritual
all these days, right?

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:51.083
After eating bland food all these days,
I felt that the curry--

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:54.958
You're right, dear.
The curry needs to be that salty.

01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:57.333
Anyway…

01:01:58.416 --> 01:02:02.000
it is because of your salt
that Pushpa's got so much pride.

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:03.708
Don't get smart with me.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:06.416
- Oh, my!
- Oh, God! Dear!

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:09.750
Why can't you be careful?

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:14.708
Look at that!

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:17.583
These are golden feet, my dear.

01:02:21.166 --> 01:02:22.833
But why do they carry
cheap silver anklets?

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:26.333
- Hey, Kesava!
- Yes, macha.

01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:28.416
I won't step inside.
Just tell me.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:33.541
Order gold anklets for your vadina
from Kalyan Jewelers.

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:34.875
Done, macha.

01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:40.375
Never mind.
I'll select them myself.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:42.041
Remind me.

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:44.000
Let go of my foot.

01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:46.125
- What is it?
- I said, let go!

01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:48.875
- Why, dear?
- You are Pushpa Raj.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.958
Don't let others mock you
for touching your wife's feet.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:55.166
Dear. Not just with pride,

01:02:55.791 --> 01:03:01.458
even in matters of love,
Pushpa Raj never backs down.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.125
I'll just shout in front of the syndicate.
Don't take it to heart.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.875
Hey! What do you think of Pushpa Raj?

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:18.250
There will be no excuses next time.

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:20.916
- Come, dear.
- What is it?

01:03:21.916 --> 01:03:24.666
- I'm getting the feelings.
- Why? What did I do now?

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:27.291
- How did you get the feelings?
- But you touched my feet.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:30.125
- Does one get feelings from touching feet?
- Yes, dear. They do.

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.333
- Why are you unbuttoning my shirt?
- Stop, dear.

01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:35.833
Once the meeting's done,
I'll come as early as possible.

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:38.875
- Dear, you always say the same thing.
- Stop unbuttoning it.

01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:40.500
- Listen to me--
- The feeling will be lost, dear.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.625
- I'll get them back for you.
- Come, dear.

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:45.666
Don't make noise.
It won't be good.

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:49.375
This is not a joke.
Stop holding me.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.541
- Come, dear.
- What's this? It's so wrong.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:53.833
- They can hear us.
- Dear!

01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.083
They'll hear us, dear!

01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:20.958
Once at six, once at seven
Sometimes even just before ten

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:26.291
When I'm asleep, when I wake up
Even when I'm sitting idle, once more

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:29.958
When you press my finger once
When you step on my toes once

01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:33.583
But every single time
You're beside me

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:37.166
- The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:40.583
They're overwhelming me
These feelings

01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:44.083
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:47.791
They're overwhelming me
These feelings

01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:56.916
When you ask me to go away
When you push me away

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.166
Also when you secretly say yes

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:02.125
When you're adorned
In flowers and jewelry

01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:05.416
Even when you drape a simple sari

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.000
When you stretch your body
And when you sweep the floor

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:12.833
But when you draw water
Truly once

01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:16.250
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:19.666
They've drowned me in them

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:23.208
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:05:23.291 --> 01:05:27.291
They've drowned me in them

01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:58.291
When you're grinding
Chutney in the kitchen

01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:01.916
And brushing the sweat with your sari

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.750
When I dry your shirt on the line
When it reminds me of your scent

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:12.416
When you tie your hair in a knot
When you sleep hugging the pillow

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.333
When you yawn in exhaustion

01:06:16.416 --> 01:06:19.750
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:23.208
They've drowned me
These feelings

01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:26.833
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:30.833
They're overwhelming me
These feelings

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:09.041
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.458
They're overwhelming me
These feelings

01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:16.041
The feelings come rushing
The feelings come rushing

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:20.041
They've drowned me
These feelings

01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:42.791
Why are you putting your leg on me?

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:45.625
Dear.

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:49.416
This is my leg.
This is also my leg.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:53.250
I put it on my own leg.
What's your problem?

01:07:54.416 --> 01:07:56.791
I'm getting the feelings, dear.

01:07:57.625 --> 01:08:00.375
- Come.
- Dear! Dear!

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:02.166
- Why only when you feel like it?
- Dear!

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.291
- What about my feelings?
- Dear!

01:08:17.208 --> 01:08:18.750
Hey!

01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:22.500
What's with the wide eyes?

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:27.333
I sent her to you to see if you
still had any manhood left.

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:30.125
Daksha, turn off the lights.
Turn it off, Daksha!

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:31.083
That's it.

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:33.583
That Pushpa taught you how to be shy.

01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:35.166
Keep hiding and living like this.

01:08:37.083 --> 01:08:40.250
That ruffian made me a widow
and took my brother away from me.

01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:41.208
Brother-in-law!

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:45.791
My blood is boiling.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.791
You can just sit and stare.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.500
But this Daksha won't stop
until I see his death.

01:08:51.375 --> 01:08:53.541
He came in as a laborer
and became the owner of the syndicate.

01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:55.708
Do you have any idea
what he's up to now?

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.958
He's planning to sell
thousands of tons to other countries.

01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:02.291
He's been procuring every log
he can get his hands on.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.583
Those hidden deep under are surfacing.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.500
Those hidden in the air
are dropping down.

01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:15.791
Trees, rivers, and streams.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:25.041
Bike, auto, car, and everything else.

01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:31.458
Everything with wheels
is transporting Pushpa's sandalwood.

01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:39.416
There's no trace of where
all this stock is being transported.

01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:02.583
But Pushpa is surely
planning something big.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.833
Instead of Murugan, he's dealing
with someone from Dubai directly.

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:36.791
He bought off a station today.
Tomorrow, he'll buy the state.

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:39.458
We must stop it at any cost.

01:10:40.666 --> 01:10:42.250
I have a plan.

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:44.375
Bicha Reddy.

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:48.250
He used to work for me previously.
He's a syndicate member now.

01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:50.791
I know how he transports his stock.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:55.250
If you could catch him and intimidate
him, the entire syndicate would tremble.

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:58.208
My husband Mangalam Srinu
will take care of the rest.

01:10:58.333 --> 01:11:00.500
First, scare him
and prove your manliness.

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:04.875
{\an8}I will. First hand me my pants.

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:08.333
Am I your wife
to fetch your pants for you?

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:10.875
You're sitting on my pants.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:31.666
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:34.291
Isn't it cold?

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.291
There's a bottle in the jeep.

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:40.291
I'm feeling it outside, not inside.

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:44.125
Hey! Shekhawat sir is feeling cold.

01:11:57.666 --> 01:12:00.291
Hey! Do you know what you're doing?

01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:02.791
It's worth 300 million!
Will you burn it down?

01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:06.541
Don't you know what happens
if you touch syndicate stock?

01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:08.500
Shekhawat sir!

01:12:08.916 --> 01:12:11.500
Have you forgotten Pushpa stripping you?

01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:13.041
Hey!

01:12:22.666 --> 01:12:24.041
You bonehead!

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:27.000
- Hey!
- Sir!

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:29.166
Why are you shouting?
Aren't you supposed to be scared?

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.625
Be afraid.

01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:31.875
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:34.541
Dakshayani asked us to scare him.
But he's shouting.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.166
- No, sir.
- What's your name?

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:37.291
He's scared.

01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:39.958
Really?

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:42.458
You can see it in his eyes.

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:47.750
I don't think so.
It's more like a shock. See for yourself.

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:50.250
It's fear, sir.

01:12:55.541 --> 01:12:57.541
{\an8}- This is fear.
- No! Oh, my!

01:12:57.625 --> 01:12:59.958
{\an8}- This expression is missing there.
- Sir, let me go.

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:03.833
Hey! No! I'm coming.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.333
Mr. Kupparaju.

01:13:05.666 --> 01:13:07.541
I know what his problem is.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.333
He knows we can't do anything.

01:13:12.708 --> 01:13:14.375
Syndicate member, right?

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.958
Pushpa Raj is his strength.

01:13:23.208 --> 01:13:26.750
I have an idea to scare him,
Mr. Kupparaju.

01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:27.791
What is it, sir?

01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:36.625
Sir! Sir!

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.083
Yes!

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.375
- Now he's scared.
- He's dead, sir.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.625
He was scared
before he died, Mr. Kupparaju.

01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:52.291
- When he shouted?
- Just before that.

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:53.833
- What happened?
- He wasn't scared up here.

01:13:53.916 --> 01:13:55.625
- But he was down there.
- He burnt it all.

01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:58.125
Sadly, we couldn't see that.

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:01.958
- We couldn't see?
- Oh, my! Bicha Reddy!

01:14:02.958 --> 01:14:06.250
Hey, Shekhawat! What did you do to him?
Did you push him?

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:08.000
I didn't do anything.

01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:10.375
I asked his name.

01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:12.250
He got scared and jumped off.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:14.583
This is what I'd say.

01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:18.416
But everyone will think
we pushed him.

01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:23.333
We needed him alive.
You could have just threatened him.

01:14:23.666 --> 01:14:24.708
Why kill him?

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.166
If I only threatened him,

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:31.458
he'd have been frightened alone.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:33.833
But if I kill him…

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:37.708
the entire syndicate will be terrified.

01:15:23.416 --> 01:15:26.708
What's up, guys? Why do you all look like
corpses just because that guy is dead?

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.958
Is no one going to speak up
even after all this?

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:31.916
I already told you.

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:34.458
This won't stop
with my brother-in-law's death.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.666
This is what happens when you
hand over the reins to ignorant fools.

01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:41.291
Hey, Srinu. Don't you have
a sense of occasion?

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:43.541
He is also at fault.

01:15:43.833 --> 01:15:46.500
We warned him
about the police in that area.

01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:49.333
- He didn't listen.
- He died. What can anyone do?

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:52.166
Why is the MP answerable when that guy
jumped off the bridge out of fear?

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:53.458
You dimwit!

01:15:53.541 --> 01:15:54.833
He didn't jump and die.

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.250
He died because he was pushed.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:58.791
Ma'am, you make it sound like
you were there and saw it all.

01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:03.541
Regardless of whether he jumped
or was pushed, we'd be dead.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.916
He's right.

01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:09.416
Bicha Reddy's death tells us
what happens if we support Pushpa.

01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:11.458
It's like a warning.

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:12.833
MP sir.

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:15.625
You favored Pushpa over Srinu
and handed over the syndicate to him.

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:18.083
We accepted it out of respect for you.

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:20.375
But how can we continue
when lives are lost like this, sir?

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:25.000
First, clear the rift
between Pushpa and Shekhawat.

01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:28.500
Or hand over the syndicate
back to Mangalam Srinu.

01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:32.000
Lives are more important than money, sir.

01:16:41.916 --> 01:16:42.875
MP sir!

01:16:43.208 --> 01:16:45.708
Please have a new road
laid to the graveyard.

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:46.833
It's full of potholes.

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:49.416
We'll be frequenting this route now.

01:17:06.916 --> 01:17:07.750
Sir.

01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:09.458
- MP is here.
- The MP?

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:10.791
Why is he here?

01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:13.000
- What business does he have here?
- No idea, sir.

01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:14.583
{\an8}Mr. Siddappa!

01:17:15.541 --> 01:17:16.875
{\an8}I didn't harm him.

01:17:17.416 --> 01:17:18.375
I asked his name.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.250
He lost his nerve and jumped down.

01:17:22.291 --> 01:17:23.833
- Right, Mr. Kupparaju?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:25.166
He lost his nerve and jumped down.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:26.875
What are you doing with your hand?

01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:28.708
As if I pushed him!

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:30.916
I meant to say he jumped, sir.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:32.500
Sorry, sir.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.916
Hey, bring some drinks over to sir!

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.416
- No, no! Bring nannari.
- Hey!

01:17:37.083 --> 01:17:38.166
Stop your act!

01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:39.958
What?

01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:43.208
You do whatever you want,
and expect me to stay quiet?

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.333
Don't stay quiet, sir.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:47.791
Get me transferred.

01:17:48.958 --> 01:17:50.041
{\an8}Talk to the CM

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:51.916
{\an8}and get me transferred.

01:17:54.958 --> 01:17:57.750
{\an8}You know that's not going to happen.
That's why we are desperate.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:02.000
{\an8}Alright.

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:03.875
{\an8}Forget the past.

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:05.500
{\an8}For compensation,

01:18:06.166 --> 01:18:07.541
{\an8}I'll have Pushpa pay 100 million.

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:08.791
{\an8}Deal?

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:12.208
{\an8}- Culination?
- No, sir.

01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:14.500
{\an8}He meant "compensation."

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:17.333
Compensation.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.083
One hundred million.

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:22.333
What is this?

01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:24.958
You're turning a minor issue
into a major problem.

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:26.958
There were just the two of you there.

01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:31.583
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:34.750
{\an8}- Step outside for a minute.
- Okay, sir.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:43.875
Take off your shirt, MP sir.

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:45.250
What?

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:46.708
Your shirt. Take it off.

01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:49.250
- Hey!
- Or the pants.

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:52.791
You're going too far.

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:55.291
Do you even realize
who you're talking to?

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.166
See that?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:58.916
See that?

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:02.291
It's just the two of us here.

01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:04.625
You're angry because I asked you to strip.

01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:07.666
But he stripped me bare!

01:19:19.416 --> 01:19:20.333
What did you say?

01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:22.750
He'd offer 100 million?

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:27.083
Even a high-class escort
would strip for one hundred thousand.

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.583
But when I stripped,

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:35.958
I'm being given a mere 100 million?

01:19:36.708 --> 01:19:38.833
{\an8}I'm a big streetwalker.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.625
{\an8}A big one!

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:31.250
Happy now?

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.583
We get into politics
only after shedding everything.

01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:37.500
There's nothing left to lose.

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:40.041
Hey, SP.

01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:43.791
You're just as important
to this business as Pushpa is.

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:46.250
This business will run smoothly
only if you two get along.

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:48.208
I'm ready to do whatever it takes
to make that happen.

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:50.625
What more do you want?

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:54.708
Before all of these,

01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:57.666
do you know what the toughest part is?

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:06.208
Not knowing how to take revenge
on our enemy.

01:21:10.791 --> 01:21:12.416
I'll make Pushpa apologize to you.

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:17.333
Will Pushpa apologize?

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.041
If you tell him to…

01:21:21.666 --> 01:21:22.916
will he apologize?

01:21:25.458 --> 01:21:28.458
I'm the one who made that coolie
the syndicate president.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.750
He'd give up his life for me.

01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:33.541
Mr. Kupparaju!

01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:35.166
- Mr. Kupparaju!
- Sir!

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:37.833
Hey, close the door
and come inside.

01:21:42.166 --> 01:21:43.458
Sir, the MP…

01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:46.333
Pushpa even made the MP strip.

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:48.083
That's not important.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.541
Will Pushpa apologize?

01:21:50.416 --> 01:21:52.000
- To you?
- Yes.

01:21:52.333 --> 01:21:54.291
He won't, sir.
He's too proud.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:56.583
He won't back off, right?

01:21:58.791 --> 01:22:00.958
It sounds good when he says it.

01:22:07.625 --> 01:22:09.500
Let him say it then.

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.750
"Compensation."

01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:14.541
Pushpa. Sorry.

01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:17.041
Mr. Siddappa.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.166
Everyone must listen to his apology.

01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:20.750
Throw a huge party!

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.666
Invite the whole syndicate.

01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:25.333
{\an8}BHANWAR SINGH SHEKHAWAT

01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:26.708
{\an8}The party's on, Pushpa.

01:22:27.541 --> 01:22:28.583
{\an8}It's definitely on.

01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:37.625
- Has he arrived?
- Not yet.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.833
Shekhawat is here.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:54.000
Welcome, SP.

01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:55.250
Mr. Siddappa.

01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:56.666
Is Pushpa here?

01:22:56.916 --> 01:22:58.083
He hasn't arrived yet.

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:00.166
Wasn't he supposed to be here at eight?
It's nine now.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:01.625
I sent someone to bring him.

01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:04.125
- Prasad. Call up Jakka Reddy.
- It's alright.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:05.291
I'll wait.

01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:10.500
Mr. Siddappa, 20 years ago,
I waited for a girl for three hours…

01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:12.458
hoping she'd say, "I love you."

01:23:13.041 --> 01:23:14.125
The same feeling

01:23:14.666 --> 01:23:15.625
never occurred again.

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:16.666
But it happened today!

01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:18.958
It's alright. I'll wait.

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:38.250
What's happening, Pushpa?

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:43.583
Because of your fight with Shekhawat,
one of us is dead.

01:23:45.291 --> 01:23:46.750
Everyone has turned against us.

01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:55.458
The syndicate might go back
to Mangalam Srinu's control.

01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:00.666
Pushpa…

01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:03.000
Your only option now is…

01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:05.291
to do as Siddappa says.

01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.041
Come to the party…

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:11.541
and apologize to Shekhawat.

01:24:16.041 --> 01:24:16.958
Or else…

01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:21.875
whatever the syndicate decides,

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:25.166
I'll have to follow it.

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.125
Let's go.

01:24:39.166 --> 01:24:40.666
Whatever the MP says,

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.083
is for your own good, dear.

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:44.791
Isn't he the one

01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:47.708
who made you
the syndicate president that day?

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.958
If he is telling you this,

01:24:50.666 --> 01:24:51.875
it must be for your own good.

01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:55.125
That's just how I feel.

01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:57.541
You know what's best to do.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.166
- Dear!
- Watch out!

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:08.416
Hold on, I'm coming with you!

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:11.875
I think the SP sir

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:14.416
is quite sure that

01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:16.875
Pushpa will apologize to him.

01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:19.541
If he doesn't…

01:25:20.875 --> 01:25:22.708
it will be like, "He didn't do it."

01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:23.958
But if he does,

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.208
it'll be like, "Why did he do it?"

01:25:27.833 --> 01:25:28.750
Watch out.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.375
Dear…

01:25:57.208 --> 01:25:58.125
Hey, Pushpa!

01:25:58.791 --> 01:25:59.666
How are you?

01:26:00.458 --> 01:26:01.333
Do you remember me?

01:26:01.958 --> 01:26:03.500
Are you here to apologize?

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.208
I'm here to watch.

01:26:20.833 --> 01:26:21.750
Mr. Kupparaju.

01:26:22.416 --> 01:26:23.291
Sir.

01:26:24.333 --> 01:26:27.416
When he apologizes,
it should be heard by everyone.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.041
- Stop the song.
- Okay, sir.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:31.875
Stop it.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:33.083
Stop the song.

01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:42.166
Pushpa?

01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:43.958
Tell him.

01:26:53.916 --> 01:26:55.750
What's there to think for two words?

01:26:56.333 --> 01:26:57.208
Go on.

01:27:08.833 --> 01:27:09.750
Pushpa!

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:12.500
People are waiting.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:20.666
Hey, Pushpa!

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:22.083
Enough!
You've already had too much.

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:23.541
Leave it.

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.375
Shekhawat sir…

01:27:56.625 --> 01:27:57.500
Sorry.

01:27:58.833 --> 01:27:59.875
There you go.
He apologized.

01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:09.916
Sorry.

01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:11.166
She said it!

01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:14.541
Mr. Siddappa, Pushpa apologized!

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.125
Sorry.

01:28:18.583 --> 01:28:19.541
Sorry.

01:28:21.083 --> 01:28:21.958
Sorry.

01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:24.291
He apologized!

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.291
That's it.
Now the syndicate is safe.

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:31.000
- Mr. Kupparaju!
- Sir?

01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:32.250
Isn't it great?

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:33.750
Pushpa, she apologized!

01:28:34.083 --> 01:28:35.458
Not "she apologized," sir.

01:28:35.625 --> 01:28:36.791
"He apologized."

01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:40.875
Mr. Kupparaju, if Pushpa fires,
then it's "he apologized."

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.166
But since Pushpa turned into a flower,

01:28:44.416 --> 01:28:46.375
it's "she apologized."

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.416
This is right!

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:49.583
- Sorry.
- She apologized!

01:29:01.791 --> 01:29:03.208
- Hey.
- Macha.

01:29:04.375 --> 01:29:06.041
Did we do the right thing?

01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:07.166
Yes, macha.

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.083
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:12.333
- What do you say, dear?
- Dear.

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:14.666
Was that right?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:15.875
Yes, dear.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.666
Whatever you do
is in the best interest of the syndicate.

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:31.250
After we left…

01:29:31.791 --> 01:29:34.791
- they would have laughed, right?
- Why would they, macha?

01:29:35.375 --> 01:29:36.708
They would have.

01:29:37.916 --> 01:29:40.166
Thinking my pride has been crushed.

01:29:43.458 --> 01:29:47.833
A lot of people have been waiting
to see Pushpa back down.

01:29:54.875 --> 01:29:57.041
Everyone has it on the inside.

01:29:57.666 --> 01:30:00.125
When someone is on top,

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.416
the rest will be anticipating their fall.

01:30:05.375 --> 01:30:07.333
In our case, that feeling intensifies.

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:08.791
But I must say…

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:11.916
Mangalam Srinu and Daksha
never expected you to apologize.

01:30:12.791 --> 01:30:14.458
They thought
they'd get back the syndicate.

01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:16.958
They were shocked
when you apologized!

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.625
What about you?

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:21.833
Macha?

01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:24.916
Were you shocked?

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:26.666
No, macha.

01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:28.166
Why?

01:30:29.708 --> 01:30:31.083
Why weren't you shocked?

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:36.333
Did you expect me to apologize?

01:30:37.125 --> 01:30:40.125
Pushpa would stoop low
for money, and say it.

01:30:40.375 --> 01:30:42.625
Do you feel that way?

01:30:48.458 --> 01:30:51.333
I'm the kind of man who'd quit a job

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:54.125
just because they told me
not to cross my legs.

01:30:55.458 --> 01:30:58.333
Wasn't that the reason
for you to follow me?

01:30:58.416 --> 01:30:59.291
Yes, macha.

01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:03.625
Then how did you expect me to apologize?

01:31:04.708 --> 01:31:08.958
That Mangalam Srinu is better than you.

01:31:10.458 --> 01:31:11.458
He didn't think I'd apologize.

01:31:13.333 --> 01:31:15.083
He was genuinely shocked.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:20.833
- But you weren't.
- No, macha. That's not what I meant.

01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:23.000
I did get the shock, macha.

01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:24.916
Drop the act.

01:31:25.583 --> 01:31:27.125
It doesn't look good.

01:31:28.291 --> 01:31:30.333
I apologized, right?

01:31:32.333 --> 01:31:35.041
That's why you take me for a fool.

01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:36.375
No, macha.

01:31:37.041 --> 01:31:39.458
What, dear, do you feel the same about me?

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.583
Oh, dear! What are you saying?

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:45.083
- Everyone thinks the same.
- Tell him.

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:46.125
There.

01:31:48.583 --> 01:31:50.666
I find myself looking like a fool.

01:31:51.166 --> 01:31:52.375
This isn't right.

01:31:53.666 --> 01:31:55.625
Pushpa can't live like this.

01:32:02.541 --> 01:32:04.291
Macha, what happened?

01:32:07.416 --> 01:32:08.333
What's happening, Kesava?

01:32:16.916 --> 01:32:17.833
Srivalli vadina.

01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:19.958
I'm not at all shocked by this.

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:23.541
I knew this would happen.

01:32:24.708 --> 01:32:26.375
I expected the car
to turn back at Enuguloya.

01:32:26.458 --> 01:32:27.333
Right, Kesava.

01:32:27.666 --> 01:32:28.583
It happened a bit later.

01:32:28.666 --> 01:32:31.041
I'd forgive anyone who'd apologize.

01:32:31.541 --> 01:32:33.750
We're best friends now.

01:32:34.791 --> 01:32:37.375
- Tomorrow, we can discuss the commission.
- Sure.

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:38.500
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:39.500
What's this, dear?

01:32:39.625 --> 01:32:42.500
He said sorry and left,
and this guy accepted it.

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:44.458
Why are we still here?
Let's leave.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.500
There he is!

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.708
He must not return, Daksha.

01:32:57.375 --> 01:32:58.958
If he does, it's going to get messy.

01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:01.666
Hey! What is it, man?

01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:03.666
What happened?

01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:05.625
What are you doing?

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:07.666
I'm urinating.

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:09.375
Can't you see?

01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.333
Where's Shekhawat? Shekha…

01:33:15.833 --> 01:33:18.666
- Oh, God! Get him out!
- Get him!

01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:21.125
Get him out!

01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:22.750
Come out.

01:33:26.666 --> 01:33:28.125
- What have you done, Pushpa?
- Hold this.

01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:30.333
And you are shamelessly urinating!

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.083
One should feel shy to apologize,

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.375
not to urinate.

01:33:35.666 --> 01:33:36.833
Sorry, sir!

01:33:37.291 --> 01:33:38.541
Sir… sorry.

01:33:38.625 --> 01:33:39.791
- Sorry.
- Careful, sir.

01:33:40.208 --> 01:33:41.500
Sir…

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:44.333
Come, sir. Careful.

01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:49.458
Sorry.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.041
- The coat…
- Sir, jacket.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:53.916
Your jacket, sir.

01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:01.791
I worked hard to set everything right!

01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:03.625
But you came back to mess everything up.

01:34:03.916 --> 01:34:04.833
What the hell is this?

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:09.208
What setting are you talking about, sir?

01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:12.750
Getting me to apologize to him?

01:34:16.333 --> 01:34:22.083
He's a filthy idiot
who'd beg for respect.

01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:25.958
Such a filthy--

01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:27.958
Sorry, ladies.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.083
I can't hold back my cursing.
Please go back.

01:34:32.791 --> 01:34:35.125
Hey, that is dirty water!
Get a pipe. Quick!

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.125
How should a police officer be?

01:34:38.833 --> 01:34:40.333
- What's his name?
- Who, boss?

01:34:40.416 --> 01:34:41.875
The one with a tilak.

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:43.666
- Gov…
- Govindappa!

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:49.083
If he were a sincere officer like
Govindappa, I wouldn't just apologize.

01:34:49.416 --> 01:34:51.541
I'd even salute him.

01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:53.833
Hey! You should salute too!

01:34:55.041 --> 01:34:56.750
- Is vadina here?
- She's in the car.

01:34:57.791 --> 01:34:58.708
Let her stay there.

01:35:00.666 --> 01:35:02.125
What about you all?

01:35:03.375 --> 01:35:08.250
Are you all here to witness
what it's like when Pushpa apologizes?

01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:11.458
You witnessed it, right?

01:35:12.208 --> 01:35:13.416
This is how!

01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:17.166
The mind would--

01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:19.583
What's this, ladies?

01:35:19.708 --> 01:35:23.583
- Please go. I can't hold back my cursing.
- Go away.

01:35:23.791 --> 01:35:25.791
There's nothing wrong
with swearing at him.

01:35:25.875 --> 01:35:27.750
It's just wrong
to swear at him in front of you.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:28.958
- Sorry.
- Go back.

01:35:29.041 --> 01:35:29.916
- Go.
- Go back.

01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:34.875
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir?

01:35:35.708 --> 01:35:37.708
Why did I jump in the swimming pool?

01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:40.541
The car hit you accidentally

01:35:41.208 --> 01:35:42.500
and you fell in the pool.

01:35:43.333 --> 01:35:45.250
He apologized and left, right?

01:35:46.166 --> 01:35:47.416
Why is he still here?

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:48.791
He was…

01:35:49.375 --> 01:35:51.291
saying something
to the syndicate members.

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:52.541
Who was that?

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:56.666
Who wanted the syndicate president
to be changed?

01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:01.333
Did you all choose me for that position?

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:05.875
Mangalam Srinu brother.

01:36:07.166 --> 01:36:08.666
Mangalam Srinu brother.

01:36:09.666 --> 01:36:10.958
The tiger!

01:36:11.625 --> 01:36:13.833
Tiger Mangalam Srinu brother.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:18.708
Everyone used to shiver
even to speak in front of him.

01:36:18.916 --> 01:36:19.791
What, Srinu brother?

01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:24.333
He used to siphon off
five million per ton.

01:36:24.416 --> 01:36:26.416
But no one had the guts
to question him.

01:36:26.958 --> 01:36:29.083
- Did you ever ask?
- No.

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:31.041
Well, I did.

01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:35.291
I went to his house
and made him pee his pants.

01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:39.000
I showed him that
Pushpa isn't a flower, but fire.

01:36:39.125 --> 01:36:40.000
What, brother?

01:36:42.291 --> 01:36:44.416
That's how I rose to this level.

01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:47.333
You didn't bestow this on me.

01:36:52.416 --> 01:36:55.125
- Can you smell that?
- Why would there be any, sir?

01:36:55.791 --> 01:36:58.875
- Because he urinated on me.
- No, sir.

01:36:59.208 --> 01:37:02.000
He urinated on me. Didn't he?
I know, Mr. Kupparaju!

01:37:02.125 --> 01:37:03.000
Gun!

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:05.000
- Sir…
- Hey, give me the gun!

01:37:05.333 --> 01:37:07.375
- That bloody…
- Sir! Sir!

01:37:07.541 --> 01:37:09.333
I also have a gun!

01:37:09.416 --> 01:37:11.000
- I'm ready to--
- Hey!

01:37:11.083 --> 01:37:12.166
That's what pride is all about!

01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:14.500
Everyone must see the real Shekhawat.
Fire it!

01:37:15.041 --> 01:37:17.000
This guy killed Bicha Reddy, sir.

01:37:17.375 --> 01:37:19.541
- I'm not sparing him.
- Why would he kill Bicha Reddy?

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:20.875
He jumped to his death.

01:37:21.458 --> 01:37:22.958
Prove your manliness now!

01:37:23.041 --> 01:37:24.291
- Fire at him!
- No, sir.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.375
- Pushpa! Kill me first!
- I won't spare you.

01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:28.541
I don't want to see any of this.

01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:30.875
Pushpa, why lock horns with the police?

01:37:30.958 --> 01:37:32.500
You've got a load
worth billions of rupees.

01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.875
What would happen to the syndicate
if something were to happen to it?

01:37:37.875 --> 01:37:39.833
"You've got a load
worth billions of rupees.

01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:42.375
What would happen to the syndicate
if something were to happen to it?"

01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:45.916
It will collapse.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.708
What will Pushpa become?

01:37:48.166 --> 01:37:49.166
He'll become a coolie.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:50.875
Nice!

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:52.166
Sounds nice!

01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:54.958
I'll seize the entire stock.

01:37:55.166 --> 01:37:58.916
I'll guard Seshachalam like a fence.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.791
I'll filter the forest

01:38:02.375 --> 01:38:04.333
and I'll make him a coolie again.

01:38:04.416 --> 01:38:07.208
Why all these words
instead of just killing him?

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.541
Did he kill me?

01:38:11.416 --> 01:38:12.458
But I still died.

01:38:13.125 --> 01:38:15.125
In the same way, I won't kill him.

01:38:15.375 --> 01:38:17.416
But he should be dead.

01:38:18.916 --> 01:38:20.500
He must die a coolie.

01:38:21.208 --> 01:38:22.083
Superb!

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:25.125
That's what I call a challenge!

01:38:26.791 --> 01:38:28.000
Listen up now.

01:38:29.166 --> 01:38:30.958
On Monday morning,

01:38:31.666 --> 01:38:35.541
precisely at 4:11 a.m.,

01:38:36.916 --> 01:38:39.458
two thousand tons of load

01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:42.291
will pass through the Chennai border.

01:38:43.208 --> 01:38:45.375
Catch me if you have the guts, Shekhawat.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.208
Even if you
get hold of just one small log,

01:38:49.333 --> 01:38:51.166
I'll walk away from this syndicate.

01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:53.750
With an ax on my shoulder once again,

01:38:54.666 --> 01:38:56.416
I'll take up a job
as a coolie in the forest.

01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:01.166
This sounds really good.
Hey, come here.

01:39:02.125 --> 01:39:03.666
Record this.

01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:07.250
Catch me if you--

01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:09.916
Catch me if you have the guts, Shekhawat.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.833
You all join me.
Catch me--

01:39:11.916 --> 01:39:13.000
Hey! Say it!

01:39:13.333 --> 01:39:15.708
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

01:39:15.791 --> 01:39:18.291
If you do, we'll leave the syndicate.

01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:21.041
With an ax on my shoulder,

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.916
I'll take on work
as a coolie in the forest!

01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:26.916
We'll take on work
as coolies in the forest!

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.541
{\an8}We'll take on work
as coolies in the forest!

01:39:29.625 --> 01:39:32.125
{\an8}We'll take on work
as coolies in the forest!

01:39:32.208 --> 01:39:34.416
We'll take on work
as coolies in the forest!

01:39:35.458 --> 01:39:36.291
There!

01:39:36.791 --> 01:39:41.125
Now, I can see myself clearly.

01:39:42.166 --> 01:39:46.750
I'm never backing down!

01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:58.291
{\an8}Turn it. Block the road.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:06.541
{\an8}Make it fast! Make it fast!

01:40:07.041 --> 01:40:07.916
{\an8}We've reached, sir.

01:40:08.625 --> 01:40:09.750
{\an8}We surely can't miss them.

01:40:18.166 --> 01:40:19.000
{\an8}Yes, sir.

01:40:25.375 --> 01:40:26.250
{\an8}- Sir!
- Sir!

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:29.833
Did you block all the routes?

01:40:30.416 --> 01:40:33.041
Yes, sir. We blocked all the routes.
We have left no stone unturned.

01:40:33.125 --> 01:40:34.333
- Isn't it, Sandeep?
- Varadaiahpalem?

01:40:34.416 --> 01:40:36.875
Along with the check posts,
we've set up beats.

01:40:36.958 --> 01:40:39.541
- We have blocked everything.
- There's no way they can escape.

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.833
Pushpa…

01:40:52.333 --> 01:40:54.500
What was that sound?

01:40:55.458 --> 01:40:58.375
You just threw a bottle…

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.125
A bottle falling into a river
should make a burbling sound.

01:41:05.041 --> 01:41:10.166
The bottle probably hit a rock
in the river and broke.

01:41:11.833 --> 01:41:13.333
Why will there be a rock in the river?

01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:16.333
It's dried up since it is summer now.

01:41:29.916 --> 01:41:32.291
If there's no water in the river,

01:41:32.875 --> 01:41:35.791
lorries need not take the road.

01:41:38.166 --> 01:41:39.958
The lorries are not moving
along the roads.

01:41:42.208 --> 01:41:43.791
They're wading through the river!

01:41:45.125 --> 01:41:46.625
They're wading through the river!

01:42:03.333 --> 01:42:05.833
{\an8}Super plan, macha!

01:42:05.916 --> 01:42:09.458
{\an8}That Shekhawat would never guess
we'd be traveling through the river.

01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:11.458
The policemen are nowhere to be seen!

01:42:11.541 --> 01:42:12.666
- All teams, alert!
- Sir!

01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:14.625
- Copy that, sir!
- Lorries are not taking the road.

01:42:14.708 --> 01:42:15.833
They're wading through the river!

01:42:16.125 --> 01:42:16.958
Hey, not here!

01:42:17.041 --> 01:42:18.333
Everyone, get into the river!

01:42:18.916 --> 01:42:20.291
Come on! Move it!

01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:23.708
All units, come in!
Move, move!

01:42:24.458 --> 01:42:25.333
Fast!

01:42:25.416 --> 01:42:26.333
Fast!

01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:33.416
You're taking
the Mathalakonda route, correct?

01:42:33.583 --> 01:42:34.708
Yes, macha!

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.750
The truck must follow
the route I specified.

01:42:41.125 --> 01:42:43.125
And cross the border as fast as possible.

01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:53.916
Sir, we spotted the lorries in the river!

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Where?

01:42:55.083 --> 01:42:57.208
We're two kilometers
away from Mathalakonda.

01:42:57.625 --> 01:42:59.666
Cheetah One, come in!
All units move to Mathalakonda!

01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:01.625
- Alpha Two responding, sir.
- Okay, sir. We will follow it.

01:43:18.333 --> 01:43:20.000
- Yes, Kesava?
- Get the boss on the line. Now!

01:43:20.083 --> 01:43:22.250
- Okay. Boss.
- Police spotted us, macha!

01:43:22.333 --> 01:43:24.333
- What should we do?
- Where are you?

01:43:24.583 --> 01:43:25.958
We've crossed Guvvalakona.

01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:33.166
{\an8}- One more batch is approaching us.
- Hang up. I'll handle it.

01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:39.666
- Hello?
- Veeresam.

01:43:39.916 --> 01:43:41.416
- Boss.
- Hey, Malkonda.

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:42.541
Yes, boss?

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:44.583
Are our men ready?

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.541
Hey! Stop the vehicle!

01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:02.583
Stop, stop!

01:44:02.666 --> 01:44:03.500
{\an8}Stop it!

01:44:04.875 --> 01:44:05.750
Stop!

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:13.625
Back!

01:44:17.666 --> 01:44:18.708
- Hey!
- Move the truck!

01:44:23.375 --> 01:44:25.583
Beta One! What's the situation?
What is happening?

01:44:25.666 --> 01:44:29.666
They've locked us on the bridge, sir.
The trucks are crossing Guvvalakona.

01:44:30.791 --> 01:44:32.250
Alpha Two, what's the situation there?

01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:35.250
{\an8}We've been blocked by elephants.
The trucks are going towards Uthakota.

01:44:35.333 --> 01:44:36.708
- Elephants?
- Yes, sir.

01:44:38.916 --> 01:44:41.125
Alpha Three, the trucks are
heading towards Uthakota.

01:44:41.208 --> 01:44:44.375
Jump, die, do whatever it takes,
but catch them!

01:45:00.958 --> 01:45:04.000
Boss! The police vehicles
are in the river following us!

01:45:06.541 --> 01:45:09.375
{\an8}- You're crossing Uthakota, right?
- Yes, macha!

01:45:13.416 --> 01:45:15.416
- Hello?
- Someshu.

01:45:31.791 --> 01:45:33.625
Keep going! Keep going!

01:45:33.708 --> 01:45:34.875
- Fast!
- Come on!

01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:36.250
Check them! Come on!

01:46:04.041 --> 01:46:05.875
All the teams are done in, macha!

01:46:05.958 --> 01:46:08.875
{\an8}The police are swimming in Uthakota!

01:46:09.083 --> 01:46:11.625
We are just four kilometers
away from the border!

01:46:11.833 --> 01:46:12.833
Get to the road

01:46:12.916 --> 01:46:14.916
- at Puttingi Madugu as planned.
- Okay, macha!

01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:15.541
{\an8}END OF CHITTOOR

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:19.916
Hey! Stop!

01:47:22.458 --> 01:47:26.916
In Chittoor's Puttur region
Lies Renigunta town

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.750
{\an8}There, the Saturday fair
Brings all around!

01:47:40.458 --> 01:47:41.333
Kesava!

01:47:41.416 --> 01:47:42.500
Boss, he got him.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.708
{\an8}Shekhawat is obstructing the road
with bullock carts, macha.

01:47:47.458 --> 01:47:48.333
Hey!

01:47:52.166 --> 01:47:53.875
What's with the sound of gunfire?

01:47:54.125 --> 01:47:56.541
- He's firing, macha.
- Do this.

01:47:57.125 --> 01:47:58.083
Macha…

01:47:59.666 --> 01:48:00.541
Jump now!

01:48:00.625 --> 01:48:01.541
Macha?!

01:48:03.791 --> 01:48:07.166
- Jump off the vehicles!
- How can we jump with so much goods?

01:48:07.375 --> 01:48:08.583
The goods are not important to me.

01:48:09.250 --> 01:48:11.833
You guys are.
Ask everyone to jump.

01:48:13.416 --> 01:48:15.458
The boss asked all of us
to jump out of the vehicles!

01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:17.166
Okay, brother!

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:27.666
Guys! Jump!

01:49:25.958 --> 01:49:27.875
Shekhawat sir… sorry.

01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:30.583
Shekhawat sir… sorry.

01:49:31.541 --> 01:49:33.291
Shekhawat sir… sorry.

01:49:33.375 --> 01:49:35.500
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:38.083
If you do, we'll leave the syndicate

01:49:38.208 --> 01:49:40.333
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

01:49:40.625 --> 01:49:42.916
If you do, we'll leave the syndicate

01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:47.708
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

01:49:47.958 --> 01:49:50.416
If you do, we'll leave the syndicate

01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:54.916
Sir, please don't drink.
There's a press meet outside.

01:49:56.250 --> 01:50:00.041
If we tell them we captured these goods,
they'll think I'm drunk.

01:50:00.541 --> 01:50:01.416
That's why…

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:02.625
Sir.

01:50:03.875 --> 01:50:04.958
I'll get drunk and talk.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.291
{\an8}Morning. Please come.

01:50:16.916 --> 01:50:19.458
{\an8}- Sir! Sir!
- Where did you catch this load?

01:50:19.541 --> 01:50:21.291
{\an8}Where did you get this information from?

01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:22.458
{\an8}- Wait, wait.
- Sir.

01:50:22.541 --> 01:50:23.458
{\an8}Tell us, sir.

01:50:23.541 --> 01:50:25.125
{\an8}- Sir!
- In the history of Chittoor district,

01:50:25.458 --> 01:50:27.125
{\an8}this is the first time
such a huge amount of goods

01:50:27.541 --> 01:50:28.458
{\an8}have been confiscated.

01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:30.458
{\an8}- Sir.
- It's a big achievement by the police.

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:32.333
{\an8}- Sir.
- This is what you need to print.

01:50:32.416 --> 01:50:33.625
{\an8}- Sir, please.
- I need not say it.

01:50:33.708 --> 01:50:35.041
- Singi Reddy!
- Boss.

01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:37.791
Call the MP and ask him to arrange
a syndicate meeting.

01:50:38.166 --> 01:50:40.833
My husband will be in charge
of the syndicate from now on.

01:50:42.125 --> 01:50:44.666
That coolie should not be
anywhere near the syndicate.

01:50:45.125 --> 01:50:46.458
- Alright.
- Hey, Daksha.

01:50:46.833 --> 01:50:47.750
Yes, dear?

01:50:50.666 --> 01:50:51.541
What is it?

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:57.916
{\an8}You confiscated the goods.
When will you arrest the smuggler?

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:58.875
{\an8}Sir.

01:50:59.083 --> 01:51:00.250
{\an8}- What we seized isn't red sandalwood, sir.
- What smuggler?

01:51:01.208 --> 01:51:02.125
{\an8}This smuggler?

01:51:03.416 --> 01:51:04.333
{\an8}- Or this smuggler?
- Sir.

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.500
{\an8}Or is it this smuggler?

01:51:06.708 --> 01:51:07.666
{\an8}Sir, sir.

01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:10.083
{\an8}Do you mean to say that
Pushpa is behind all this?

01:51:10.458 --> 01:51:11.833
{\an8}- What's your name?
- Sorry?

01:51:12.208 --> 01:51:14.166
{\an8}- What's your name?
- Minnu Uma Devi, sir.

01:51:14.833 --> 01:51:16.791
{\an8}- What's your name?
- Reddyraju Sitaram Raju, sir.

01:51:16.875 --> 01:51:19.875
{\an8}- Sir…
- Tell me the full name.

01:51:20.125 --> 01:51:21.583
{\an8}- Then I'll arrest him.
- But, sir…

01:51:21.666 --> 01:51:24.125
{\an8}- Sir…
- Thank you! Thank you!

01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:28.500
Is it true?

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.041
All of you wait outside.

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:32.708
- Ask the press to leave as well.
- Go outside.

01:51:32.791 --> 01:51:34.500
- Move!
- Leave.

01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:37.291
- Hey, go outside.
- Hey, tell them to stop.

01:51:41.583 --> 01:51:42.750
Isn't this red sandalwood?

01:51:43.583 --> 01:51:45.583
No. It's sandra.

01:51:46.458 --> 01:51:47.416
What's sandra?

01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:51.708
Just like you and my husband
look like men,

01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:54.208
that too only looks like sandalwood.

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:56.083
But it's not real sandalwood.

01:51:57.875 --> 01:51:58.750
Srinu?

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.708
I can't tell the difference!

01:52:02.875 --> 01:52:05.458
Sandra is only red on the surface.

01:52:05.708 --> 01:52:08.083
Sandalwood is red even on the inside.

01:52:08.916 --> 01:52:11.250
This won't sell for even
10,000 rupees per ton in the market!

01:52:13.041 --> 01:52:15.291
Brother, the goods have
crossed the border.

01:52:15.458 --> 01:52:16.375
Murugan called to inform us.

01:52:18.083 --> 01:52:22.833
Even an ant can't cross the forest
without my permission!

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.333
How did the goods pass through?

01:52:58.416 --> 01:52:59.291
Sir!

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.041
We found this during last night's raid.

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:10.000
GOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH

01:54:10.083 --> 01:54:13.083
FOREST DEPARTMENT
RED SANDALWOOD WAREHOUSE

01:54:32.291 --> 01:54:33.166
Sir!

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:35.041
He's asking you to shove this!

01:54:35.333 --> 01:54:36.666
No, Mr. Kupparaju.

01:54:37.083 --> 01:54:40.166
He's saying that the red sandalwood
reached Chennai.

01:54:40.333 --> 01:54:42.166
Oh! That's your understanding?

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:54.000
Sir, he's calling you dumb.

01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:55.958
Mr. Kupparaju, he is not speaking Telugu.

01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:58.708
I'm understanding this
just as much as you are.

01:54:58.791 --> 01:54:59.791
You don't need to explain it to me.

01:55:04.416 --> 01:55:05.500
Pushpa sent this for you, sir.

01:55:09.416 --> 01:55:10.291
Oh!

01:55:18.708 --> 01:55:21.250
Sir, he's calling you a red flower.

01:55:22.208 --> 01:55:25.583
He only said flower.
Please don't add color.

01:55:26.041 --> 01:55:27.916
This is just a flower.

01:55:39.083 --> 01:55:41.208
Not one flower?
Three, it seems, macha.

01:55:52.833 --> 01:55:53.750
Three flowers.

01:55:55.375 --> 01:55:56.333
These flowers!

01:56:01.041 --> 01:56:03.083
- What did he say?
- I can't tell you.

01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:07.083
What else! He might have said
that he fooled him!

01:56:17.125 --> 01:56:20.291
He's asking him to pack his bags
and leave for Rajasthan!

01:56:28.666 --> 01:56:29.541
I don't get it, sir.

01:56:30.625 --> 01:56:33.583
{\an8}The goods crossed the state border
but didn't leave the country.

01:56:33.666 --> 01:56:35.666
{\an8}I'll confiscate those goods
and bring them back here.

01:56:36.083 --> 01:56:38.583
I'll prove that
what I seized is red sandalwood.

01:56:39.166 --> 01:56:40.500
He'll surely not get it.

01:56:47.375 --> 01:56:48.958
Sir, he understood.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:50.541
He says you can't beat him.

01:56:55.833 --> 01:56:57.291
He vowed to leave the syndicate
if we confiscated one log.

01:56:57.791 --> 01:56:58.833
We got an entire cart.

01:56:59.333 --> 01:57:00.250
Mr. Kupparaju!

01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:04.833
Hey, coolie! Coolie!

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.750
Coolie. Hey, coolie!

01:57:10.666 --> 01:57:13.000
- Come here.
- Why is he calling him back?

01:57:13.250 --> 01:57:14.250
It'll be dangerous if he comes back.

01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:25.166
You swore to leave the syndicate
if I got even one log.

01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:27.666
I've confiscated an entire cart!

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.458
Coolie! You're a coolie.

01:57:31.541 --> 01:57:34.791
With an ax on your shoulder

01:57:35.125 --> 01:57:38.458
Take on work as a coolie in the forest!

01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:40.250
Coolie!

01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:42.166
Coolie!

01:57:45.416 --> 01:57:46.875
Did you think…

01:57:49.166 --> 01:57:50.541
Pushpa means flower?

01:57:53.208 --> 01:57:54.958
Fire, right?
I know.

01:57:56.791 --> 01:57:58.083
No!

01:58:00.416 --> 01:58:02.625
{\an8}Wildfire!

01:58:40.791 --> 01:58:44.125
Mr. Srinu, arrange an urgent
meeting for me.

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:48.333
- With whom?
- The game hasn't ended, Mr. Srinu.

01:58:49.666 --> 01:58:52.875
It's only just beginning!

01:59:07.333 --> 01:59:08.583
Look there! Uncle!

01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:12.125
- I'll be right back, Mom.
- No, Kaveri!

01:59:13.375 --> 01:59:15.791
Kaveri, your dad will be upset!

01:59:15.875 --> 01:59:16.708
- Uncle!
- Kaveri!

01:59:17.833 --> 01:59:19.000
Uncle, look!

01:59:19.458 --> 01:59:20.541
Do you remember this chain?

01:59:20.791 --> 01:59:21.875
Grandpa gave it to you.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:22.958
I wore it.

01:59:23.541 --> 01:59:26.166
- How are you, Kaveri?
- I'm good, Auntie.

01:59:26.250 --> 01:59:28.583
- Are you studying well, dear?
- Yes, Auntie.

01:59:29.416 --> 01:59:30.541
Uncle, look.

01:59:30.833 --> 01:59:33.083
Tell me if you want it.
I'll give it to you.

01:59:35.833 --> 01:59:40.000
See that, Auntie? I always call him
"Uncle," but he simply ignores me.

01:59:40.083 --> 01:59:42.666
- He doesn't even respond.
- Nothing of that sort.

01:59:42.958 --> 01:59:46.958
He acts like that on the outside,
but he's always happy to see you.

02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:07.583
Come here.

02:00:13.541 --> 02:00:15.291
- Srivalli!
- What happened, Srivalli?

02:00:15.375 --> 02:00:16.500
- Auntie!
- What happened?

02:00:16.583 --> 02:00:19.083
- Get a chair!
- Hey, get a chair.

02:00:19.166 --> 02:00:22.125
- Srivalli, look here.
- Keep it here.

02:00:22.583 --> 02:00:23.458
Open your eyes.

02:00:24.375 --> 02:00:27.041
- What happened?
- Let her get some fresh air.

02:00:27.125 --> 02:00:28.375
Wait…

02:00:28.625 --> 02:00:30.875
- She had been fasting since morning.
- Srivalli.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.875
Srivalli.

02:00:33.791 --> 02:00:36.291
All the men, please step outside!

02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:37.875
Pushpa, step aside.

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.291
- Move it!
- Go, Pushpa.

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:41.750
- Take care.
- Go.

02:00:41.875 --> 02:00:43.000
- I'll take care of her.
- Srivalli.

02:00:43.458 --> 02:00:45.333
- Srivalli.
- Srivalli.

02:00:46.666 --> 02:00:47.916
Did you get your period this month?

02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:52.333
How long has it been since the last one?

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.541
You didn't pass out from mere fatigue.

02:01:02.958 --> 02:01:04.250
It's all because of Pushpa's romance!

02:01:04.416 --> 02:01:05.666
What are you saying?

02:01:06.458 --> 02:01:07.708
What are you talking about?

02:01:07.791 --> 02:01:10.291
Parvathamma, you're going
to be a grandmother!

02:01:10.375 --> 02:01:11.291
Srivalli.

02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.958
- Hey!
- Hail Goddess Gangamma!

02:01:13.041 --> 02:01:15.125
The man to beat Pushpa is on the way!

02:01:15.208 --> 02:01:16.958
The real celebrations start now!

02:01:17.041 --> 02:01:18.958
- Hail Goddess Gangamma!
- Hail Goddess Gangamma!

02:01:19.041 --> 02:01:21.541
- Guys, let's get some sweets.
- Vadina, have this.

02:01:27.708 --> 02:01:28.666
Where's Pushpa?

02:01:33.208 --> 02:01:38.458
With her feet adorned in red mehendi
She came to rule us

02:01:38.541 --> 02:01:40.583
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:01:43.583 --> 02:01:48.666
With black kohl, she graces us

02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:51.041
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:01:53.291 --> 02:01:58.416
With jingling anklets, she leads us

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:03.125
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:51.041
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.333
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:02:54.208 --> 02:02:55.583
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:02:56.458 --> 02:02:58.166
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:02:58.666 --> 02:03:00.875
- Draped in vibrant sari
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:00.958 --> 02:03:03.125
- She entered the village
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:03.208 --> 02:03:05.250
- Adorned with jasmine
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:05.333 --> 02:03:07.291
- She brings in the festivities
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:07.375 --> 02:03:09.750
- With tangedu blooms
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:09.833 --> 02:03:11.958
- She leaps into color
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:12.041 --> 02:03:14.208
- With nose rings shining
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:14.291 --> 02:03:16.458
- She rules all three worlds
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:16.541 --> 02:03:18.666
- She looks ahead
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:20.875
- With three hundred eyes
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:20.958 --> 02:03:23.083
- She looks back
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:23.166 --> 02:03:25.250
- With two hundred eyes
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:03:25.333 --> 02:03:27.500
Who is a greater goddess than you
In this entire world?

02:03:27.583 --> 02:03:29.750
What do we have to offer
As our humble naivedhyam to you?

02:03:29.833 --> 02:03:31.958
Answer our cries
Bless us with your boons, O Mother!

02:03:32.041 --> 02:03:36.583
Protect us, your children
Dear Mother!

02:04:03.583 --> 02:04:04.875
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:05.458 --> 02:04:06.875
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:07.375 --> 02:04:08.625
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:10.666
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:26.375 --> 02:04:27.500
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:28.208 --> 02:04:29.458
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:29.958 --> 02:04:31.208
Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:04:54.916 --> 02:04:55.833
What's this, dear?

02:04:56.625 --> 02:04:57.750
Why are you doing this?

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:01.583
What's with the costume and dancing?

02:05:04.375 --> 02:05:07.041
If I dress as a woman
and perform before the Goddess,

02:05:08.125 --> 02:05:09.958
our wishes will be granted.

02:05:10.333 --> 02:05:11.916
What did you wish for, dear?

02:05:12.583 --> 02:05:14.000
You are Pushpa Raj!

02:05:14.666 --> 02:05:17.875
People come to you
when they need something.

02:05:18.416 --> 02:05:20.416
But what do you need, dear?

02:05:20.875 --> 02:05:22.166
What did you wish for?

02:05:26.333 --> 02:05:28.291
I prayed for a daughter.

02:05:30.333 --> 02:05:32.833
Why should it make a difference
whether it's a boy or a girl?

02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:34.875
It doesn't matter.

02:05:39.375 --> 02:05:40.625
If I have a son,

02:05:41.125 --> 02:05:44.500
I'm just a coolie who can't even
pass on a surname to him.

02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:49.208
If I have a daughter…

02:05:52.083 --> 02:05:53.416
she'll eventually go to another home…

02:05:55.333 --> 02:05:56.916
and take their surname.

02:05:59.916 --> 02:06:01.458
That's why I wore this costume.

02:06:09.125 --> 02:06:11.666
People say he's rough and tough

02:06:11.791 --> 02:06:17.375
But to me, he's a tender soul

02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:24.333
The world thinks he's stubborn

02:06:24.416 --> 02:06:29.791
But to me, he's a king

02:06:35.333 --> 02:06:40.166
His words may be sharp
But his heart is soft

02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:46.833
Who knows the god within him
Better than I do?

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.333
He looks like a spark of fire, my man

02:06:57.208 --> 02:07:02.500
Soft like a cotton flower
A child, my man

02:07:35.958 --> 02:07:40.541
You see anger in his reddened eyes

02:07:41.083 --> 02:07:45.625
But only I see the hidden tears

02:07:51.041 --> 02:07:56.000
You only notice his fierce mustache

02:07:56.083 --> 02:08:00.666
I see the smile hiding behind it

02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:05.583
You see him
Stride like a tiger in the wild

02:08:05.791 --> 02:08:12.666
But only Srivalli knows him
Coming home tired and resting in her lap

02:08:12.833 --> 02:08:18.166
He looks like a spark of fire, my man

02:08:23.125 --> 02:08:28.666
He is soft like a cotton flower
A child, my man

02:09:07.583 --> 02:09:12.583
A nobleman who gives away grand gifts

02:09:12.666 --> 02:09:17.500
But begs me for kisses, so humble

02:09:22.875 --> 02:09:27.750
The man handles big tasks with ease

02:09:27.833 --> 02:09:32.458
Yet, he needs me
To find his shirt, how amusing!

02:09:32.541 --> 02:09:37.375
He stands up against many men outside

02:09:37.458 --> 02:09:44.291
But he won't leave the house
Without me crossing his path first

02:09:44.583 --> 02:09:50.166
He looks like a spark of fire, my man

02:09:54.750 --> 02:10:00.666
With such a wonderful husband
Any girl would feel like a queen

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:04.958
Hey!

02:10:18.666 --> 02:10:19.583
Hey!

02:10:21.291 --> 02:10:22.208
Hey, dude!

02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.875
Is this a woman
or a man dressed as a woman?

02:10:25.208 --> 02:10:27.333
- Take a look.
- Look.

02:10:27.458 --> 02:10:29.333
- This one's surely a man.
- Hey!

02:10:29.916 --> 02:10:30.791
You crazy idiot!

02:10:31.666 --> 02:10:32.916
Have you gone blind?

02:10:33.416 --> 02:10:34.666
Can't you tell a man and a woman apart?

02:10:35.125 --> 02:10:37.500
Hey, girl.
Is this your boyfriend?

02:10:37.583 --> 02:10:38.458
Hey!

02:10:38.666 --> 02:10:40.166
I'll smack you with a slipper!

02:10:40.541 --> 02:10:41.916
Is it a duplicate?

02:10:42.375 --> 02:10:44.958
It looks like an original.
Where did you buy it?

02:10:45.916 --> 02:10:47.125
It's original, bro.

02:10:47.208 --> 02:10:48.583
No. It's a duplicate.

02:10:48.666 --> 02:10:50.208
I doubt it.

02:10:50.291 --> 02:10:52.000
Dude! Hold her!

02:10:52.416 --> 02:10:53.625
I'll remove her sari.

02:10:54.791 --> 02:10:56.916
- Yeah.
- I'm holding her. You remove it.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.083
- Come on!
- Let go of me.

02:11:00.166 --> 02:11:01.416
- Let go!
- Go ahead, Bugga.

02:11:04.083 --> 02:11:06.083
We'll find out once we remove it
and take a look.

02:11:06.375 --> 02:11:07.291
Let go!

02:11:25.541 --> 02:11:26.416
Hey!

02:12:01.291 --> 02:12:04.708
- Gango Renuka Thalli!
- Gango Renuka Thalli!

02:12:20.416 --> 02:12:22.708
You said your uncle
doesn't care for you, right?

02:12:23.458 --> 02:12:26.666
Watch how he unleashes his fierce side
when someone messes with you!

02:15:11.458 --> 02:15:13.666
Hey! Let him go.

02:15:14.416 --> 02:15:15.416
He might die.

02:15:16.166 --> 02:15:17.791
Everyone witnessed your heroism.

02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:19.458
What now?

02:15:19.958 --> 02:15:23.375
Do you think taking them all down
makes you one of us?

02:15:23.875 --> 02:15:24.750
Dad!

02:15:25.833 --> 02:15:27.750
No matter how many schemes you pull,

02:15:28.083 --> 02:15:29.208
you'll never earn our surname.

02:15:29.916 --> 02:15:32.791
You'll always remain just Pushpa Raj.

02:15:36.375 --> 02:15:38.791
Dad! Why are you saying such things?

02:15:38.916 --> 02:15:40.083
They misbehaved with me.

02:15:40.583 --> 02:15:43.208
Do you know what would have
happened if Uncle hadn't shown up?

02:15:43.291 --> 02:15:44.166
Oh, God!

02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:45.458
Who's your uncle?

02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:47.458
This is your uncle!

02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:49.500
Born to my mother and father.

02:15:49.916 --> 02:15:51.833
I didn't lose my honor
when they harassed you.

02:15:51.916 --> 02:15:54.708
I lost it when you called him
"Uncle" in front of everyone!

02:15:55.125 --> 02:15:57.166
Hey! What is this?

02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:00.500
Is that really how you treat someone
who saved your daughter?

02:16:00.583 --> 02:16:02.333
What? He saved her?

02:16:02.583 --> 02:16:04.875
He was looking for such an opportunity.

02:16:05.458 --> 02:16:06.500
An opportunity came,

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.666
and not only did he dress as a woman,
but he also played the role of an uncle.

02:16:09.958 --> 02:16:12.083
He's behaving like
he's the one who rescued her.

02:16:12.791 --> 02:16:14.083
Hey, big man!

02:16:14.166 --> 02:16:17.208
- Hey…
- Does all this look like a drama to you?

02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:18.791
Not just your daughter.

02:16:18.916 --> 02:16:22.041
My husband would save
any woman in such a situation!

02:16:22.416 --> 02:16:23.750
That's his principle.

02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:26.166
Make some sense with your words.
What a life!

02:16:26.250 --> 02:16:29.416
- Srivalli, respect his age.
- Please be quiet, Mother.

02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:32.625
You may remain silent
when he speaks ill of your son.

02:16:32.708 --> 02:16:35.500
But if someone messes with my husband,
I won't spare them!

02:16:36.208 --> 02:16:39.000
After all the good he's done for them,
does he deserve their disrespect?

02:16:41.708 --> 02:16:45.250
Hey! When my husband's eyes turn red,

02:16:45.541 --> 02:16:47.875
the entire Chittoor district
trembles with fear!

02:16:48.666 --> 02:16:52.000
I saw tears in those eyes…

02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:54.875
only because of you.

02:16:56.333 --> 02:16:57.541
Even the other day,

02:16:58.166 --> 02:17:00.416
when he came to see me for our wedding,

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.583
this man brought tears
to my husband's eyes.

02:17:04.625 --> 02:17:05.791
Even today,

02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:08.416
when I told him
we were going to have a child…

02:17:10.125 --> 02:17:12.791
Any husband would feel elated.

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:17.500
But my husband… cried.

02:17:20.166 --> 02:17:21.375
All because of you.

02:17:22.375 --> 02:17:23.291
Dear…

02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:25.750
pull yourself together.
You're carrying a child.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:26.875
Stay quiet, Mom!

02:17:27.541 --> 02:17:29.916
How long are you going to keep
dwelling on the surname?

02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:31.666
Who cares about your surname?

02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:34.416
Those without a name need a surname!

02:17:35.250 --> 02:17:37.791
The entire village is living
on my husband's name!

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:42.208
- Who are you?
- Pushpa's manager.

02:17:42.333 --> 02:17:43.541
- You?
- Pushpa's friend.

02:17:43.666 --> 02:17:44.958
- What about you?
- Pushpa's driver.

02:17:45.083 --> 02:17:46.500
- You?
- Part of Pushpa's gang.

02:17:48.416 --> 02:17:52.083
No one tells you their actual name here.

02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:54.500
They call themselves Pushpa's man.

02:17:55.208 --> 02:17:56.541
Forget all this.

02:17:57.041 --> 02:17:58.041
Who is he?

02:17:58.583 --> 02:17:59.625
Pushpa's elder brother.

02:18:00.541 --> 02:18:01.625
Just great!

02:18:02.166 --> 02:18:03.875
This is my husband!

02:18:04.791 --> 02:18:05.625
Hey!

02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:08.916
Pushpa isn't just a name.

02:18:09.708 --> 02:18:11.208
Pushpa is a brand!

02:18:13.416 --> 02:18:14.333
- Auntie.
- Hey!

02:18:15.375 --> 02:18:17.541
Enough with your relations!

02:18:18.125 --> 02:18:20.375
They're here, right?

02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:21.625
Call them all you want.

02:18:22.208 --> 02:18:24.291
Let him go!
Let them settle this!

02:18:24.375 --> 02:18:25.250
Come, let's go!

02:18:27.958 --> 02:18:28.791
Dear…

02:18:29.666 --> 02:18:30.625
shall we leave?

02:19:28.333 --> 02:19:29.375
Oh, my!

02:19:29.791 --> 02:19:35.333
Shekhawat has neatly organized all
the duplicate stuff to match the original.

02:19:36.125 --> 02:19:37.208
Hey, Shekhawat.

02:19:37.416 --> 02:19:40.250
Like you said,
I've brought in one ton of the stuff.

02:19:40.583 --> 02:19:41.958
What will you do with it?

02:19:42.875 --> 02:19:44.458
I will use this stuff

02:19:44.791 --> 02:19:46.916
to get hold of the original one.

02:19:47.291 --> 02:19:48.166
I don't understand.

02:19:48.291 --> 02:19:50.083
The stuff has crossed the state border

02:19:50.458 --> 02:19:52.750
but it hasn't left the country.

02:19:53.541 --> 02:19:56.875
Wherever the stuff is,
I will find it and keep it here.

02:19:57.875 --> 02:20:00.041
I'll prove that…

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:01.666
what I seized is red sandalwood.

02:20:01.916 --> 02:20:03.125
Hey, what are you doing?

02:20:06.541 --> 02:20:08.083
When will you do all this?

02:20:08.291 --> 02:20:09.833
You're trending on the TV and paper

02:20:09.916 --> 02:20:12.333
for seizing such a huge amount
of red sandalwood.

02:20:12.833 --> 02:20:15.958
Your lies will be out in the open
when the inspection committee arrives.

02:20:19.375 --> 02:20:20.583
This is red sandalwood.

02:20:21.291 --> 02:20:22.416
Original. A grade.

02:20:23.833 --> 02:20:24.750
What were you saying, Daksha?

02:20:25.791 --> 02:20:27.750
The inspection committee's
coming in the afternoon…

02:20:27.833 --> 02:20:29.416
to check whether
this is red sandalwood or not.

02:20:29.666 --> 02:20:31.458
I am asking
how you are going to manage it.

02:20:32.458 --> 02:20:35.333
I won't be managing the committee.

02:20:36.083 --> 02:20:38.958
The committee will be coming to manage me.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.625
- Sir, why are you heading inside?
- Sir, what are you going to do now?

02:20:44.708 --> 02:20:45.583
What?

02:20:46.625 --> 02:20:47.666
The visiting committee…

02:20:48.458 --> 02:20:50.500
{\an8}will only test this stuff.

02:20:56.333 --> 02:20:57.375
This is a physical test.

02:20:57.541 --> 02:21:01.041
While drilling,
if the powder is red till the end then…

02:21:01.125 --> 02:21:02.666
- Yes.
- it's one hundred percent red sandalwood.

02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:04.083
The kerosene's color didn't change…

02:21:04.166 --> 02:21:06.166
{\an8}- that means it is original red sandalwood.
- Okay.

02:21:06.416 --> 02:21:08.625
They will certify it

02:21:09.208 --> 02:21:10.250
stating that the entire stuff
is red sandalwood.

02:21:10.333 --> 02:21:12.958
All the red sandalwood samples
brought in are of A grade.

02:21:13.541 --> 02:21:17.250
Our whole team believes
that the red sandalwood is A grade.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.750
Until we find the original stuff,

02:21:20.291 --> 02:21:22.750
we will make them believe
that this is the original red sandalwood.

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:26.208
The seized red sandalwood will be
auctioned as per the procedure.

02:21:26.458 --> 02:21:28.583
We'll hand over the amount
to the government treasury.

02:21:28.666 --> 02:21:30.375
- Sir, Pratap Reddy's on the line.
- You seized red sandalwood worth crores!

02:21:30.458 --> 02:21:33.208
- Sir, this is a breaking news!
- Sir, how proud does this make you feel?

02:21:33.291 --> 02:21:34.250
Yes, brother. Tell me.

02:21:34.333 --> 02:21:36.291
What's this circus on TV, Siddappa?

02:21:36.958 --> 02:21:38.250
The police have seized the stuff.

02:21:38.916 --> 02:21:40.250
How will you bring the money now?

02:21:40.833 --> 02:21:42.375
I've already spoken to everyone, man.

02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:43.625
No, brother.

02:21:43.916 --> 02:21:45.875
Pushpa said that
the load has already reached.

02:21:46.208 --> 02:21:47.333
That's what I don't understand.

02:21:47.416 --> 02:21:48.458
Pushpa!

02:21:49.583 --> 02:21:51.750
PRAJA CHAITANYA PARTY OFFICE

02:21:52.291 --> 02:21:53.708
What does that coolie have to lose?

02:21:53.791 --> 02:21:56.166
- Switch on the camera!
- Be ready!

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.500
If something goes wrong,
he'll just go to the forest with an axe.

02:21:58.583 --> 02:22:01.041
Pushpa…

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:03.708
The public won't even spare
our party flag.

02:22:19.416 --> 02:22:20.500
Pushpa's here.

02:22:20.916 --> 02:22:22.625
I'll talk to Pushpa and get back to you.

02:22:43.375 --> 02:22:46.166
What is this, Pushpa? What is Shekhawat
blabbering in front of the press?

02:22:46.416 --> 02:22:47.500
That's not the truth.

02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:49.625
He's proven that what he's seized
is in fact red sandalwood.

02:22:50.041 --> 02:22:51.250
No, it's sandra.

02:22:52.083 --> 02:22:53.583
Then where's the original?

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.291
Wherever it is…

02:22:56.583 --> 02:22:58.958
It's ready to cross the border.

02:23:00.291 --> 02:23:04.166
How can we believe that it is sandra
after we sent the stuff

02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:05.625
risking our lives
and with so much planning?

02:23:05.708 --> 02:23:07.750
He believed that it was red sandalwood
because we sent it that way.

02:23:08.208 --> 02:23:10.250
I heard that there was a big party
at Mangalam Srinu's house last night.

02:23:10.333 --> 02:23:11.583
Even Murugan was present at the party.

02:23:11.666 --> 02:23:14.416
Apparently Murugan
and Shekhawat had a long talk.

02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:17.000
If that was sandra, then why would
Murugan attend the party?

02:23:17.083 --> 02:23:17.916
No, brother.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.500
He had challenged that if the stuff gets
seized he would leave the syndicate.

02:23:20.875 --> 02:23:22.250
Then tell him to leave it.

02:23:30.375 --> 02:23:32.416
He's still in that "fair" mood.
Be careful.

02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:34.750
I said that it isn't sandalwood.

02:23:35.041 --> 02:23:36.708
Can't you understand?

02:23:40.458 --> 02:23:43.083
If it had been sandalwood,
would I be this relaxed?

02:23:46.083 --> 02:23:47.708
If that is red sandalwood…

02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:49.875
then I don't want a single penny.

02:23:50.708 --> 02:23:51.958
What if it is sandra?

02:23:52.875 --> 02:23:54.833
Then don't ask us for your share
in the stuff that we have.

02:23:54.916 --> 02:23:55.791
Alright.

02:23:56.541 --> 02:23:58.125
You have the real stuff.

02:23:58.958 --> 02:24:00.208
We're all very close here.

02:24:00.916 --> 02:24:03.000
- Just tell us where the stuff is!
- Mr. Siddappa!

02:24:03.125 --> 02:24:05.416
You guys might have a good bond.

02:24:05.875 --> 02:24:08.083
But we need proof of where our stuff is.

02:24:08.166 --> 02:24:09.250
- Yes, we do!
- We do!

02:24:09.333 --> 02:24:11.708
- We need proof!
- Yes, we want proof.

02:24:11.791 --> 02:24:13.625
Get him to tell us where our stuff is!

02:24:13.708 --> 02:24:14.625
- Make him tell us!
- Make him tell us!

02:24:14.708 --> 02:24:15.583
We need proof!

02:24:22.416 --> 02:24:25.500
If I reveal where the stuff is, it would
be like whispering it in Shekhawat's ear.

02:24:27.208 --> 02:24:28.500
That's what he wants as well.

02:24:29.875 --> 02:24:32.250
He's weaving this tale
to get it out of us.

02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:35.875
That sir…

02:24:37.708 --> 02:24:38.625
Pushpa.

02:24:40.041 --> 02:24:42.083
Everyone gave you the stuff
because they trust you.

02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:44.791
As a president of the syndicate…

02:24:45.333 --> 02:24:47.500
it's your job to make them believe.

02:24:47.583 --> 02:24:53.500
It's difficult to get each of them
to believe at the level I'm at.

02:24:55.333 --> 02:24:57.250
There's no truth in business.

02:24:57.833 --> 02:24:58.958
There's just trust.

02:25:00.041 --> 02:25:02.083
Things here will only happen
if there's trust.

02:25:03.125 --> 02:25:05.208
If I am saying that this is a red shirt…

02:25:05.541 --> 02:25:07.708
then you have to believe
that it is a red shirt!

02:25:07.791 --> 02:25:09.875
- What color shirt is this?
- Red color!

02:25:10.125 --> 02:25:11.458
This is what you call business!

02:25:24.416 --> 02:25:25.375
Jakka Reddy,

02:25:26.208 --> 02:25:27.083
I'll put my faith in you

02:25:27.916 --> 02:25:29.458
and show you where the stuff is.

02:25:30.083 --> 02:25:31.875
But I'll only show it to you.

02:25:35.958 --> 02:25:37.250
- Hey, Kesava!
- Macha.

02:25:37.458 --> 02:25:40.291
Call me once they all agree.

02:25:40.916 --> 02:25:41.875
I'm leaving.

02:25:48.666 --> 02:25:52.625
Siddappa… whoever believes that brother's
wearing a red shirt, call me.

02:25:52.791 --> 02:25:53.750
Even I'll leave.

02:25:57.041 --> 02:26:00.208
They hold meetings for trivial reasons!
What kind of business is this?

02:26:00.708 --> 02:26:02.625
Mr. CS, what are you following?

02:26:02.708 --> 02:26:03.541
Whatever it is,

02:26:03.625 --> 02:26:06.166
{\an8}resolve the issues
without my interference.

02:26:06.250 --> 02:26:08.458
{\an8}I'll initiate the process
and get it done immediately, sir.

02:26:09.250 --> 02:26:11.625
What's all this in a cabinet meeting?

02:26:11.708 --> 02:26:12.541
Sir.

02:26:13.541 --> 02:26:15.291
Hey, Srinu.
How are you doing?

02:26:15.375 --> 02:26:17.166
- I'm fine, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

02:26:21.333 --> 02:26:22.916
What? Siddappa?

02:26:25.125 --> 02:26:28.791
I've known Siddappa for 30 years.
He's not capable of something like that.

02:26:28.875 --> 02:26:31.458
Someone else is pulling the strings
behind the scenes, sir.

02:26:31.666 --> 02:26:32.708
Pushpa Raj.

02:26:33.208 --> 02:26:34.125
Pushpa?

02:26:34.958 --> 02:26:37.958
The boy once came to meet me.

02:26:38.291 --> 02:26:40.500
He also wanted a photo, but I refused.

02:26:40.833 --> 02:26:43.500
If you hadn't, the matter
wouldn't have come this far.

02:26:43.583 --> 02:26:47.458
Sir, a five billion deal
was closed with Pratap Reddy.

02:26:47.875 --> 02:26:52.750
Yes, sir. 110 MLAs are busy negotiating
with Siddappa and Pushpa.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.875
If the goods are sold and the money
comes in, Pushpa will buy off MLAs.

02:26:57.708 --> 02:26:58.916
And Siddappa will become the CM.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.750
Are you implying that
I'll become the ex-CM?

02:27:01.833 --> 02:27:03.333
Are you sure you're thinking straight?

02:27:05.625 --> 02:27:10.250
You stirred up drama in the media
saying you confiscated red sandalwood.

02:27:10.333 --> 02:27:13.666
Are you acting because they'll find out
it's not sandalwood and you'll get caught?

02:27:14.291 --> 02:27:15.208
Alright, sir.

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:18.083
Let's meet again during
Siddappa's swearing-in ceremony.

02:27:18.166 --> 02:27:19.583
- Listen…
- Hey!

02:27:21.625 --> 02:27:22.500
Wait.

02:27:25.416 --> 02:27:27.083
You've got a point.

02:27:27.583 --> 02:27:29.791
I sensed danger the moment I found out

02:27:30.333 --> 02:27:33.875
we were getting so much money
from the syndicate.

02:27:34.041 --> 02:27:35.083
What do I do now?

02:27:35.166 --> 02:27:36.958
The SP was hoping

02:27:37.208 --> 02:27:40.750
you'd speak to the Tamil Nadu CM
and get the support of the local police.

02:27:40.833 --> 02:27:43.125
I don't believe anything before I see it.

02:27:43.291 --> 02:27:45.250
First, locate the goods
and show them to me.

02:27:45.333 --> 02:27:47.333
I'll believe it then.
Where are the goods?

02:27:47.458 --> 02:27:50.208
The only person who knows
the location of the goods is Jakka Reddy.

02:27:52.541 --> 02:27:54.166
We followed him.

02:27:56.333 --> 02:27:58.625
We got to know
that the goods are in Rameshwaram.

02:27:58.791 --> 02:28:02.041
{\an8}RAMESHWARAM
TAMIL NADU

02:28:02.250 --> 02:28:05.166
{\an8}We need to seize it
before it crosses the country.

02:28:09.541 --> 02:28:13.000
MP sir! I'm in Rameshwaram,
and the goods are safe.

02:28:13.458 --> 02:28:15.916
- Tell our syndicate members not to worry.
- Jakka Reddy!

02:28:16.708 --> 02:28:17.625
Come.

02:28:17.833 --> 02:28:19.000
- I'll call you back.
- Hey!

02:28:20.208 --> 02:28:21.083
Come.

02:28:22.375 --> 02:28:23.666
What are they saying?

02:28:24.375 --> 02:28:27.208
Sri Lanka, 18 kilometers!

02:28:29.458 --> 02:28:30.625
Eighteen kilometers!

02:28:31.458 --> 02:28:33.666
We'll go, right?
That close.

02:28:45.958 --> 02:28:46.958
POLICE

02:28:53.708 --> 02:28:55.125
Move! Get out of the way!

02:29:13.166 --> 02:29:14.500
{\an8}Did Charlie come into contact?

02:29:15.208 --> 02:29:17.625
{\an8}No, sir. His phone has been
switched off since morning.

02:29:31.541 --> 02:29:33.166
- What are you searching for?
- Sir?

02:29:35.375 --> 02:29:36.833
Not small fish.

02:29:37.375 --> 02:29:39.625
What I need is a whale!

02:29:39.875 --> 02:29:42.041
- Alpha Three calling.
- Did you find something?

02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:44.083
Check everywhere.

02:29:44.291 --> 02:29:45.916
{\an8}There's nothing other than
fishing nets in these boats, sir.

02:29:46.083 --> 02:29:47.875
There's nothing in this boat either.

02:29:47.958 --> 02:29:48.916
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

02:29:58.458 --> 02:30:00.083
What is an Arabic container doing here?

02:30:04.333 --> 02:30:05.458
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

02:30:05.875 --> 02:30:08.083
Do you see that container in the distance?

02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:10.125
- Yes, sir.
- Ask them to check it.

02:30:11.583 --> 02:30:13.000
Ponnusami come in.

02:30:21.791 --> 02:30:23.500
Sir. There's nothing boxes in here.

02:30:23.583 --> 02:30:24.625
Check it thoroughly.

02:30:44.125 --> 02:30:46.250
Don't let that car escape. Stop it.

02:30:46.333 --> 02:30:47.375
Hey, come this way.

02:30:47.916 --> 02:30:49.791
Come on, guys.
Come on.

02:31:05.583 --> 02:31:08.500
These guys are all here.
That means the stuff is here as well.

02:31:08.875 --> 02:31:11.458
We've checked thoroughly.
Only the ocean is left.

02:31:12.208 --> 02:31:13.125
Let's check that too.

02:31:13.916 --> 02:31:14.791
- Sir!
- Sir!

02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:31.500
Hey, Kupparaju! Catch them!

02:32:31.583 --> 02:32:33.166
- Tamil Nadu Police!
- Come on!

02:32:42.291 --> 02:32:44.083
Sir is here. Go fast!

02:32:45.291 --> 02:32:47.041
{\an8}- Fast! Fast!
- Come on, sir.

02:32:47.125 --> 02:32:48.791
{\an8}- Come, sir.
- Sir.

02:32:49.333 --> 02:32:51.416
- Fast! Follow!
- Come on!

02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:52.416
Follow!

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.166
Fast! Come on, hurry!

02:33:37.166 --> 02:33:38.916
Hey! Why are you stopping?

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.291
- Sri Lanka border.
- Sri Lanka border, sir.

02:33:40.375 --> 02:33:41.500
But those boats are going!

02:33:43.291 --> 02:33:45.250
Those are fishing boats, sir.
They have permission, we don't.

02:33:45.333 --> 02:33:47.166
- So what?
- Sir! Sir!

02:33:47.250 --> 02:33:48.833
International border, sir.
We could land in trouble.

02:33:48.916 --> 02:33:51.666
I don't see any borders.
I see only boats, Mr. Kupparaju.

02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:54.208
- No, sir.
- Please, sir! We'll land in trouble!

02:34:01.708 --> 02:34:02.791
- Hey!
- Stop!

02:34:03.333 --> 02:34:05.083
- Go back!
- Hey!

02:34:05.166 --> 02:34:06.166
What are you doing?

02:34:06.541 --> 02:34:07.416
Stop! Stop!

02:34:09.041 --> 02:34:10.000
Stop!

02:34:14.791 --> 02:34:18.083
You're not allowed to cross the border.
Or we'll have to shoot.

02:34:18.333 --> 02:34:20.000
- Sorry!
- You better turn back.

02:34:20.458 --> 02:34:22.333
- You guys don't have the permission.
- Sorry!

02:34:23.625 --> 02:34:25.375
- We aren't crossing.
- This is an international border.

02:34:25.458 --> 02:34:27.375
Turn around and be on your way.

02:34:33.083 --> 02:34:35.416
Sir. The boats have reached Sri Lanka.

02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:36.375
Already?

02:34:36.625 --> 02:34:38.541
It was eighteen kilometers from
there, but only six from here, sir.

02:34:39.916 --> 02:34:40.958
Sir, we'll land in trouble!

02:34:41.041 --> 02:34:42.125
Sir! Sir!

02:34:43.291 --> 02:34:44.208
Sorry!

02:34:45.208 --> 02:34:46.958
We're not crossing the border. Sorry.

02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:58.666
Sir!

02:35:29.708 --> 02:35:30.916
What's this, Mr. Kupparaju?

02:35:31.625 --> 02:35:32.708
Don't borders matter to him?

02:35:33.625 --> 02:35:35.291
He's on both sides.

02:35:36.125 --> 02:35:37.666
Is he some sort of lord?

02:35:38.083 --> 02:35:39.375
Oh, God.

02:35:56.916 --> 02:35:57.791
What happened, sir?

02:35:59.750 --> 02:36:00.583
Finished!

02:36:12.125 --> 02:36:15.250
- Yes. Ponnusami.
- There's been an accident, sir.

02:36:16.666 --> 02:36:17.541
Accident?

02:36:19.625 --> 02:36:23.291
{\an8}POLICE

02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:27.500
Sir, this car fell off
while they were trying to escape.

02:36:37.666 --> 02:36:39.500
Sir, Jakka Reddy is dead.

02:36:40.333 --> 02:36:42.375
- Oh, the other one's alive.
- Jakka Reddy.

02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:48.416
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

02:36:48.833 --> 02:36:50.666
We did find a big whale.

02:36:51.333 --> 02:36:52.666
- Who is it, sir?
- Hameed.

02:36:53.541 --> 02:36:54.750
International broker.

02:36:59.166 --> 02:37:02.750
If this rod goes
another three inches inside,

02:37:03.208 --> 02:37:04.166
you'll be dead.

02:37:05.375 --> 02:37:07.333
One question per inch.

02:37:08.875 --> 02:37:10.291
Where's all that stuff going?

02:37:11.250 --> 02:37:12.250
Japan.

02:37:15.333 --> 02:37:16.958
Mr. Kupparaju, Japan!

02:37:18.708 --> 02:37:22.250
How's Pushpa going to receive the money?

02:37:23.083 --> 02:37:25.041
- Korasoki.
- What's that?

02:37:25.125 --> 02:37:26.791
Japanese hawala.

02:37:36.208 --> 02:37:39.666
Just like we gave Pushpa half a note…

02:37:40.625 --> 02:37:43.458
once the stuff reaches Japan,

02:37:46.708 --> 02:37:48.666
The Japanese broker there…

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.500
will take the half note from the buyer.

02:37:59.416 --> 02:38:00.625
The broker from there

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.958
sends the half note
to the local operator.

02:38:05.291 --> 02:38:08.000
Pushpa will bring that money from him.

02:38:08.083 --> 02:38:09.791
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

02:38:09.875 --> 02:38:11.500
We'll be finding another whale.

02:38:12.708 --> 02:38:13.625
Who's that broker?

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.458
Tell me his name.

02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:22.625
I'll tell you.

02:38:22.958 --> 02:38:24.708
His name--

02:38:29.416 --> 02:38:30.458
Does Pushpa know him?

02:38:30.541 --> 02:38:33.708
Nobody knows him.

02:38:33.833 --> 02:38:37.208
- Only I do.
- No one else?

02:38:45.125 --> 02:38:47.333
Why did you kill him
when he was about to reveal his identity?

02:38:49.791 --> 02:38:53.291
If he reveals,
Pushpa will come to know his identity.

02:38:53.375 --> 02:38:54.500
How would he know, sir?

02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:56.458
One of us could tell him.

02:38:57.083 --> 02:38:59.041
That guy would reveal it
just for one crore.

02:38:59.583 --> 02:39:01.791
For two crores, this guy would reveal it.

02:39:02.291 --> 02:39:05.083
- For five crores… you might reveal it.
- Sir, me?

02:39:05.458 --> 02:39:07.916
Who knows? For a hundred crore
even I might reveal it.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.375
Pushpa is capable of making me reveal it.

02:39:12.458 --> 02:39:14.375
Sir. This guy's still alive.

02:39:17.208 --> 02:39:19.458
He'll reveal if he's alive.

02:39:20.625 --> 02:39:23.458
You'll listen to it
and pass it on to Pushpa.

02:39:24.291 --> 02:39:25.208
And I will…

02:39:29.708 --> 02:39:30.583
Mr. Kupparaju.

02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:32.125
Did you kill him?

02:39:32.958 --> 02:39:33.833
Tamilnadu police!

02:39:34.208 --> 02:39:36.583
Big smuggler!
And Mr. Kupparaju shot him!

02:39:41.916 --> 02:39:43.666
Do you realize what you've done?

02:39:44.958 --> 02:39:50.333
With just one bullet, you've cut
the connection between Pushpa and Japan.

02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:53.166
The load has reached Japan.

02:39:53.416 --> 02:39:55.000
But, the cash won't come.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.416
What will happen to the syndicate?

02:39:58.291 --> 02:39:59.625
What will happen to Siddappa?

02:40:02.958 --> 02:40:04.166
Sir, giving it to him.

02:40:05.958 --> 02:40:08.541
Macha, Mr. Siddappa is on the line.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:11.875
Sir.

02:40:12.250 --> 02:40:15.041
CM Narasimha Reddy has come
to know about all this.

02:40:15.583 --> 02:40:17.333
That's why I've invited
all the MLAs on our side

02:40:17.416 --> 02:40:19.791
on the pretext of my granddaughter's
saree function.

02:40:20.416 --> 02:40:23.791
They don't seem to listen to us
until we pay at least an advance.

02:40:23.958 --> 02:40:24.833
The money would come, right?

02:40:24.916 --> 02:40:27.958
Sir, the money will arrive on time.

02:40:28.916 --> 02:40:31.750
You'll become the Chief Minister
on the date I announced.

02:40:33.416 --> 02:40:35.250
If that doesn't happen,

02:40:36.458 --> 02:40:39.083
this Pushpa will stop eating salt.

02:40:48.041 --> 02:40:50.583
Ready a container full of red sandalwood.

02:40:53.083 --> 02:40:53.958
But why, macha?

02:40:57.625 --> 02:41:02.958
If my money is over the seven hills
or over the seven seas,

02:41:04.625 --> 02:41:05.958
I'm not letting it go.

02:41:59.458 --> 02:42:00.625
Pushpa!

02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:32.458
Jump and get him.

02:42:32.666 --> 02:42:34.166
Yes, sir!

02:42:48.583 --> 02:42:49.458
Greetings, boss.

02:42:51.875 --> 02:42:53.041
Do you have any idea who he is

02:42:53.583 --> 02:42:55.541
and how he got here from India?

02:42:55.625 --> 02:42:56.958
I'll look into it and find out, boss.
You may leave.

02:42:59.583 --> 02:43:01.375
Did the cash reach our dealer in India?

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.333
Find out.

02:43:07.041 --> 02:43:07.958
Okay, boss.

02:43:11.833 --> 02:43:12.708
- What's--
- Boss!

02:43:57.833 --> 02:43:58.875
Don't shoot!

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:14.125
I apologize for the inconvenience
caused to you.

02:44:14.375 --> 02:44:16.416
I promise, this won't happen again.

02:44:16.625 --> 02:44:20.000
Your money will be ready
by the time you go back to your country.

02:44:20.125 --> 02:44:22.833
How did you ever think
you'd come this far and escape death?

02:44:24.333 --> 02:44:27.291
If a human is breathing,

02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:29.250
it means he's alive.

02:44:29.791 --> 02:44:32.541
If someone like me is breathing,

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.541
it means I'm growing to new heights.

02:44:38.583 --> 02:44:39.791
A grade…

02:44:40.625 --> 02:44:41.916
Tabla piece!

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.791
The shape changed but…

02:44:47.250 --> 02:44:49.250
it smells the same.

02:44:50.708 --> 02:44:55.125
I smell the mud
from Seshachalam Uragayalakonda.

02:45:09.208 --> 02:45:12.916
- What's this for?
- An advance for your next load.

02:45:13.208 --> 02:45:14.166
Hiroshi.

02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:18.458
From now on, these silly notes
won't have any value.

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:19.458
What do we do now?

02:45:19.541 --> 02:45:21.041
Pushpa's currency.

02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:23.333
Pushpa currency?

02:45:23.583 --> 02:45:25.625
The rupee is valid in India.

02:45:26.875 --> 02:45:29.708
The yen is valid in Japan.

02:45:31.333 --> 02:45:34.041
This is Pushpa's currency.

02:45:35.833 --> 02:45:38.375
It's valid across the globe.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.250
From now on,
only once the money arrives,

02:45:46.208 --> 02:45:47.291
the wood will be sent.

02:45:51.416 --> 02:45:52.750
{\an8}CHITTOOR
166 K.M

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:53.875
Cheers!

02:45:55.791 --> 02:45:56.750
Cheers!

02:46:19.666 --> 02:46:21.208
{\an8}H. JOSEPH
MLA

02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:23.375
Y. RAMNATH REDDY
MLA

02:46:33.166 --> 02:46:35.791
Macha, all the sofas have been dispatched.
Only this one is remaining.

02:46:35.875 --> 02:46:36.916
Who do we send this to?

02:47:56.458 --> 02:47:59.333
If there's anyone I'm indebted to,

02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:03.291
it was only to Jakka Reddy brother.

02:48:06.083 --> 02:48:08.708
That day, if he hadn't said
"Hey, Pushpa.

02:48:08.916 --> 02:48:13.291
Come and sit here.
Explain it to the MP."

02:48:14.916 --> 02:48:17.625
I wouldn't have become
the president of the syndicate.

02:48:19.416 --> 02:48:21.500
I wouldn't have made it this far.

02:48:25.375 --> 02:48:29.000
I feel disheartened
for losing someone so valueable.

02:48:34.958 --> 02:48:36.208
Knowingly or unknowingly…

02:48:38.125 --> 02:48:40.833
I became the reason
for the deaths of both your brothers.

02:48:43.291 --> 02:48:45.250
And that's troubling me.

02:48:48.208 --> 02:48:52.375
I know, you're pretty angry on me.

02:48:55.250 --> 02:48:57.708
You've been waiting
for a chance to kill me.

02:49:00.833 --> 02:49:03.791
But if you join hands with me
leaving all this behind…

02:49:08.791 --> 02:49:10.583
Each time the load is sent out…

02:49:11.958 --> 02:49:13.541
three shares of money…

02:49:15.791 --> 02:49:18.708
will reach you just like this sofa.

02:49:21.583 --> 02:49:24.250
If you seek only my life,

02:49:26.125 --> 02:49:27.041
Here…

02:49:28.708 --> 02:49:30.375
I also brought a gun along.

02:49:36.166 --> 02:49:37.208
Jali Reddy…

02:49:38.416 --> 02:49:43.500
It has always been Pushpa who decides
what I do and what the other person does.

02:49:46.583 --> 02:49:49.458
But for the first time,
I'm leaving this decision to another.

02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.166
Do you seek my death?

02:49:54.708 --> 02:49:55.750
Or money?

02:49:58.208 --> 02:49:59.250
Decide for yourself.

02:50:43.583 --> 02:50:44.625
Jali Reddy…

02:50:45.541 --> 02:50:48.791
I take it that
you only want to see me dead.

02:50:49.958 --> 02:50:53.583
You won my heart the moment
you chose the gun over money.

02:50:54.250 --> 02:50:56.750
That's why I'm giving you another chance.

02:50:57.416 --> 02:50:59.583
Come to me when you have the strength.

02:51:00.166 --> 02:51:04.791
Whenever you come,
Pushpa will be waiting.

02:51:08.583 --> 02:51:11.208
{\an8}I, Bhureddy Siddappa Naidu…

02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:14.083
{\an8}bear true faith and allegiance…

02:51:14.208 --> 02:51:20.750
{\an8}to the Constitution of India,
as established by law…

02:51:21.041 --> 02:51:27.416
{\an8}to uphold the sovereignty
and integrity of India…

02:51:29.916 --> 02:51:32.291
As the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh…

02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:36.625
take oath in the name of God.

02:51:36.958 --> 02:51:39.791
- All hail…
- Siddappa Naidu!

02:51:39.916 --> 02:51:41.750
Why is Siddappa Naidu
visiting Pushpa's home

02:51:41.833 --> 02:51:43.166
{\an8}right after becoming
the Chief Minister?

02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:44.458
{\an8}Let's ask him and find out!

02:51:44.541 --> 02:51:46.541
Ma'am, Pushpa is like my younger brother.

02:51:46.916 --> 02:51:50.458
{\an8}He invited me over
as soon as I took the oath as the CM.

02:51:50.666 --> 02:51:55.166
{\an8}I'm here because of my brother's wish.
Why make such a drama over all this?

02:51:55.250 --> 02:51:56.875
{\an8}When is the cabinet expansion, sir?

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.750
{\an8}- Seriously! Brother?
- Tell us, sir! Who will make it

02:51:59.875 --> 02:52:00.875
to your cabinet, sir?

02:52:01.166 --> 02:52:05.000
- Hey, Chintu. What's the date today?
- July 24th. Why?

02:52:05.458 --> 02:52:10.000
{\an8}The CM said he'd come to our house
on July 24th for lunch.

02:52:10.416 --> 02:52:14.708
{\an8}I'm wondering whether to cook
lamb or goat that day.

02:52:15.083 --> 02:52:18.375
He randomly said a date
and changed the CM.

02:52:19.041 --> 02:52:20.041
You're right!

02:52:21.666 --> 02:52:22.583
That's it!

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:26.250
Siddappa is the CM of the state,
and Pushpa Raj is the king.

02:52:35.625 --> 02:52:37.583
Stay right there, Pushpa.
I'm coming.

02:52:37.791 --> 02:52:39.750
When going to the temple,
one must take the stairs.

02:52:40.708 --> 02:52:41.916
Pushpa!

02:52:42.083 --> 02:52:43.458
- All hail…
- Siddappa Naidu!

02:52:43.541 --> 02:52:44.666
Hey, where's that?

02:52:46.875 --> 02:52:48.958
My first signature after becoming the CM.

02:52:49.375 --> 02:52:50.625
Transfer of Shekhawat.

02:52:53.791 --> 02:52:54.666
Happy?

02:52:54.916 --> 02:52:56.416
This may sting us.

02:52:56.958 --> 02:53:00.500
If you get him transferred now,
we'll lose our respect.

02:53:01.250 --> 02:53:03.666
If he stays,
he'll lose his respect.

02:53:04.458 --> 02:53:07.166
Think big at least now, sir.

02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:09.750
- You've become the CM.
- Whatever you say, man.

02:53:12.416 --> 02:53:18.541
Srivalli, you're flipping state politics
just like you flip dosas in the kitchen!

02:53:18.833 --> 02:53:21.625
I became the Chief Minister
only because you asked for a photo.

02:53:22.125 --> 02:53:23.000
Thanks!

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Greetings, ma'am.

02:53:27.166 --> 02:53:28.916
- Oh, my! What a son you've raised!
- Greetings, sir.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.333
I'm not saying this as Siddappa.

02:53:30.625 --> 02:53:31.583
I'm saying this as a CM.

02:53:31.666 --> 02:53:33.041
- You're a blessed soul.
- Hey, you all go.

02:53:33.125 --> 02:53:36.166
Wow! The aroma
of all the dishes is amazing!

02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:39.416
- Hey, Kesava, what did you hack today?
- It's a lamb, sir.

02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:40.875
Srivalli vadina cooked it!

02:53:41.125 --> 02:53:42.666
Please tell me how the curry is, Mr. CM.

02:53:42.750 --> 02:53:46.875
Can't you tell just by looking?
Whatever you cook is pure nectar, dear.

02:53:48.333 --> 02:53:49.500
- So, syndicate members…
- Dear!

02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:51.541
I feel scared of you, dear.

02:53:52.125 --> 02:53:53.041
Why's that, dear?

02:53:53.666 --> 02:53:55.833
Hey, what happened?

02:53:57.083 --> 02:54:02.166
Dear, all I asked for was a photo,
and you ended up changing the CM.

02:54:02.250 --> 02:54:03.333
What are you, dear?!

02:54:03.666 --> 02:54:04.583
Dear…

02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:09.333
women rarely ask for anything,
maybe once in a blue moon.

02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:13.041
If a husband can't even fulfill that,
how can he call himself a man?

02:54:13.125 --> 02:54:16.750
If our wives hear these words,
we're as good as dead.

02:54:16.833 --> 02:54:18.708
- Right, brother.
- Big salute to you, dear.

02:54:19.041 --> 02:54:21.333
- I won't ask you for anything ever again.
- Hey, Srivalli.

02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:24.958
From now on, ask me for whatever
you need, not your husband.

02:54:25.541 --> 02:54:26.458
Oh!

02:54:26.541 --> 02:54:28.333
I haven't taken a photo with you yet!

02:54:28.416 --> 02:54:30.000
Sir, you could do that after eating.

02:54:30.083 --> 02:54:33.625
Man, if you don't take a picture,
the positions are changing overnight.

02:54:33.708 --> 02:54:34.791
No, no. You--

02:54:34.875 --> 02:54:35.958
Where's that guy, "click"?

02:54:36.041 --> 02:54:38.750
- Right here, sir!
- My man!

02:54:39.625 --> 02:54:41.041
- Take a photo with Srivalli.
- Yes, sir.

02:54:41.125 --> 02:54:42.041
Come, dear.

02:54:42.250 --> 02:54:43.166
Pushpa…

02:54:43.583 --> 02:54:46.791
why did you pick
July 24th to make me the CM?

02:54:47.916 --> 02:54:51.125
Today is my wife Srivalli's birthday.

02:54:51.666 --> 02:54:54.500
If not today, when will you become the CM?

02:54:54.583 --> 02:54:55.541
Birthday gift!

02:54:56.041 --> 02:54:58.000
- Got the photo?
- Yes, sir.

02:54:58.083 --> 02:54:59.208
What about the sound?

02:54:59.583 --> 02:55:00.500
I got the photo, sir.

02:55:00.583 --> 02:55:03.291
It's not just a photo, man.
There should be a "click" sound!

02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:04.375
Hey!

02:55:04.666 --> 02:55:09.208
If you press the button here,
the former CM should hear

02:55:09.375 --> 02:55:10.625
- the "click" sound.
- The "click" sound.

02:55:10.708 --> 02:55:12.833
What's this with these "clicks"?

02:55:12.916 --> 02:55:14.416
Can't they take photos
without making that sound?

02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:16.875
"Click! Click!"

02:55:16.958 --> 02:55:20.291
One photo. My wife asked me to pose
with anyone who asked for a photo.

02:55:20.458 --> 02:55:23.083
If only I'd listened to her,
I'd be better off today. Hey, move it!

02:55:59.583 --> 02:56:01.166
Snap it, snap it, snap away!

02:56:01.291 --> 02:56:03.041
Uncle's here
Take a snap

02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:08.458
Snap it, snap it, snap away!

02:56:08.541 --> 02:56:10.208
Brother-in-law's here
Take a snap

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:17.541
The buddy is here, snap it!
The dude is here, snap it!

02:56:17.625 --> 02:56:21.250
The invitees get a snap
So do the party crashers

02:56:21.333 --> 02:56:24.791
The good, the bad
The ugly all get a snap

02:56:24.875 --> 02:56:28.250
Take photos with them
And stick them in the album

02:56:28.333 --> 02:56:31.875
But the one you clicked with me, baby
Keep it hidden safely in your locker!

02:56:31.958 --> 02:56:35.791
If these sneaky snaps slip outside

02:56:35.875 --> 02:56:40.958
You'll get smacked, oh darling!
You'll get smacked, oh!

02:56:44.958 --> 02:56:50.416
You'll get smacked, oh darling!
You'll get smacked, oh!

02:57:22.666 --> 02:57:26.750
Stand beside me and take a perfect shot
But if your hands brush my shoulders…

02:57:26.833 --> 02:57:29.833
You'll get smacked!
You'll get smacked!

02:57:29.916 --> 02:57:34.000
Alright, wrap your hands around me
But if they get naughty…

02:57:34.083 --> 02:57:37.541
You'll get smacked!
You'll get smacked!

02:57:37.625 --> 02:57:41.250
Solo photos? No problem!
Colorful photos? No problem!

02:57:41.333 --> 02:57:44.458
Let's even take a group photo
No complaints here!

02:57:44.541 --> 02:57:48.500
But posting it in public
With silly captions?

02:57:48.583 --> 02:57:53.833
You'll get smacked, oh darling!
You'll get smacked, oh!

02:57:57.666 --> 02:58:03.125
You'll get smacked, oh darling!
You'll get smacked, oh!

02:58:32.166 --> 02:58:35.791
Any pose will do
Just no exposing, or else…

02:58:35.875 --> 02:58:39.000
You'll get smacked!
You'll get smacked!

02:58:39.458 --> 02:58:42.916
Any angle's fine, click as you like
But if your mind's in the wrong angle…

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.250
You'll get smacked!
You'll get smacked!

02:58:46.750 --> 02:58:50.333
Keep the photos safe
Enjoy them leisurely

02:58:50.416 --> 02:58:53.416
Feast your eyes and have a blast!
No objections here

02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:57.583
But if you edit my face
Tweak and morph it

02:58:57.666 --> 02:59:02.625
You'll get smacked, oh darling!
You'll get smacked, oh!

02:59:06.750 --> 02:59:12.208
You'll get smacked, oh darling!
You'll get smacked, oh!

02:59:54.041 --> 02:59:54.916
It's over, sir.

02:59:55.291 --> 02:59:56.250
Everything is over.

02:59:56.708 --> 02:59:58.041
They'll auction it in two or three days.

02:59:58.375 --> 03:00:00.500
If they find out this is fake,
it's the end for both of us.

03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:02.375
You'll be suspended, and I'll be debarred.

03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:03.666
- Mr. Kupparaju.
- Sir.

03:00:04.125 --> 03:00:09.125
I just realized there's no difference
between red sandalwood and sandra.

03:00:09.208 --> 03:00:11.000
- How's that possible, sir?
- Look here.

03:00:11.333 --> 03:00:13.458
Can you tell which is red sandalwood
and which is sandra?

03:00:13.916 --> 03:00:17.791
Hold on, sir. Both are just ash, right?
How can we tell?

03:00:18.125 --> 03:00:20.375
- Exactly, Mr. Kupparaju.
- Yes, sir.

03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:24.750
Whether it's red sandalwood or sandra,
they all burn to become ash.

03:00:24.916 --> 03:00:25.833
Correct, sir.

03:00:26.041 --> 03:00:29.416
Sandra burns to become ash.

03:00:30.375 --> 03:00:31.250
Ash…

03:00:33.416 --> 03:00:34.291
Becomes red sandalwood!

03:00:35.250 --> 03:00:38.750
You're brilliant, sir!
Let's burn it. I'll bring petrol!

03:00:39.875 --> 03:00:43.166
Hey! We got the cans here already!

03:00:43.333 --> 03:00:44.791
Oh, you've already poured it?

03:00:44.958 --> 03:00:48.041
You're super-fast, sir!
Let's go outside and light it up!

03:00:48.125 --> 03:00:51.625
If it burns when we are outside,
they'll call it a conspiracy, Kupparaju.

03:00:51.708 --> 03:00:53.166
That's right, sir.

03:00:53.250 --> 03:00:56.333
But imagine if we're inside
when it's burning.

03:00:58.625 --> 03:01:00.083
- Oh, no!
- They will call it an accident!

03:01:00.166 --> 03:01:02.083
No, sir! Let's get out of here!

03:01:02.541 --> 03:01:07.916
If I'm alone, they'll get suspicious.
So, please stay back, Kupparaju!

03:01:08.333 --> 03:01:10.083
- Stay here. Please.
- Sir!

03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:11.375
Sir!

03:01:11.458 --> 03:01:15.375
A king's dead body
never leaves alone, Mr. Kupparaju.

03:01:15.833 --> 03:01:18.291
- It takes its army with it.
- Sir…

03:01:18.541 --> 03:01:20.416
And you're my army!

03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:24.375
You're the dead king, and I'm your army?!

03:01:24.541 --> 03:01:27.125
What nonsense! You sadistic idiot!

03:01:27.333 --> 03:01:28.708
Let me go, you moron!

03:01:28.916 --> 03:01:31.500
You are asking me to die, you lunatic!

03:01:31.583 --> 03:01:34.333
Hey! You'll be damned!

03:01:35.625 --> 03:01:37.791
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

03:01:38.083 --> 03:01:39.000
If you do…

03:01:39.083 --> 03:01:42.083
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

03:01:42.375 --> 03:01:45.208
If you do, I'll leave the syndicate.

03:01:45.750 --> 03:01:48.750
Catch us if you have the guts, Shekhawat!

03:01:49.125 --> 03:01:51.708
If you do, I'll leave the syndicate.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:55.208
With an ax on your shoulder,

03:01:55.416 --> 03:01:58.500
you'll take on work
as a coolie in the forest!

03:01:58.791 --> 03:02:02.833
Pushpa! She apologized!

03:02:14.250 --> 03:02:18.041
Dear! Where did you go?

03:02:18.583 --> 03:02:19.708
I'm right here.

03:02:20.250 --> 03:02:24.583
- Do you need something?
- Why are you sleeping on the floor?

03:02:26.291 --> 03:02:29.708
If my hand or leg hits you in my sleep,
it could trouble the baby.

03:02:30.666 --> 03:02:32.416
That's why I was sleeping on the floor.

03:02:36.666 --> 03:02:39.875
Take your hand off, dear.
It's time to get out of bed.

03:02:40.583 --> 03:02:42.875
Why get up? Take some rest.

03:02:55.958 --> 03:02:58.708
Dear, where are you going?

03:02:58.875 --> 03:03:01.916
I'm going to the bathroom, dear.

03:03:02.291 --> 03:03:05.625
Will you stay at home
at least after our child is born?

03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:09.250
Of course. I'll stay at home.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:13.166
I'll hand over the business to Kesava…

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:16.125
and I'll retire.

03:03:17.875 --> 03:03:21.291
I'll make it my duty
to care for you and the baby.

03:03:24.541 --> 03:03:26.666
Macha! Macha!

03:03:29.291 --> 03:03:31.583
- What's up, man?
- Come here once, macha.

03:03:32.958 --> 03:03:34.250
- Go.
- Coming.

03:03:39.416 --> 03:03:40.708
- Mohan--
- Dear…

03:03:42.208 --> 03:03:43.250
Your sister-in-law is here.

03:03:48.541 --> 03:03:50.750
Someone kidnapped our Kaveri.

03:03:53.166 --> 03:03:55.541
When she went to computer class
this morning…

03:04:06.041 --> 03:04:07.250
Who the hell are you?

03:04:09.333 --> 03:04:11.083
They called Mohan.

03:04:11.666 --> 03:04:13.166
They demanded 20 million.

03:04:14.333 --> 03:04:16.708
- What happened?
- Be ready with 20 million.

03:04:16.833 --> 03:04:18.541
I'll let you know when and where
the transaction will take place.

03:04:18.625 --> 03:04:20.666
Where am I supposed
to get 20 million from?

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.958
They told your brother to shave
his head and parade around town.

03:04:24.958 --> 03:04:27.333
It should be broadcast
on all TV channels at noon.

03:04:27.416 --> 03:04:30.416
All the revelers at the fair saw it
when our heads were shaved.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:37.333
The entire Tirupati must
witness you getting shaved.

03:04:37.583 --> 03:04:38.583
I'll do as you say.

03:04:39.291 --> 03:04:40.333
Will you let go of my daughter?

03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:42.833
Why? Won't you do it
if I don't release her?

03:04:43.458 --> 03:04:47.708
They're talking nonsense.
Your brother has no idea what to do.

03:04:49.416 --> 03:04:52.041
I'm afraid they might
do something to my daughter.

03:04:53.375 --> 03:04:55.708
What is it?
What are you thinking?

03:04:56.500 --> 03:04:57.791
She is the daughter of our house.

03:04:58.333 --> 03:04:59.750
Do something, Pushpa.

03:05:00.666 --> 03:05:02.250
- Hey, Pushpa!
- Hey, Pushpa!

03:05:02.333 --> 03:05:03.958
Every family has its share of fights,

03:05:04.083 --> 03:05:06.250
but true bonds are shown when
we stand together during tough times.

03:05:06.333 --> 03:05:08.875
What is it?
Why don't you say something, Pushpa?

03:05:09.291 --> 03:05:10.166
Pushpa…

03:05:12.541 --> 03:05:14.166
Why don't you tell him?

03:05:14.250 --> 03:05:17.083
Would he listen to me, Auntie?
He'll do as he pleases.

03:05:17.166 --> 03:05:18.125
Hey, Pushpa!

03:05:22.291 --> 03:05:23.166
Look at him.

03:05:29.875 --> 03:05:30.791
Elder sister-in-law!

03:05:30.875 --> 03:05:33.458
There's nothing to worry about.
Your daughter is safe now.

03:05:34.833 --> 03:05:38.416
Hey, call all the university students
to Annamayya Circle.

03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:39.750
Hey, start immediately.

03:05:40.208 --> 03:05:42.750
Tell them it's urgent.
Boss already started. Yes.

03:05:42.958 --> 03:05:45.916
{\an8}Hey, tell that other batch.

03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:53.166
According to our sources,

03:05:53.250 --> 03:05:58.250
the victim is Kaveri, an 18-year-old
student from a local college.

03:05:58.666 --> 03:06:02.708
Who is behind the kidnapping?
Why was she targeted?

03:06:03.500 --> 03:06:06.625
{\an8}For more details on this incident,

03:06:06.750 --> 03:06:08.541
- our Siti Cable correspondent--
- Move it, lady.

03:06:08.625 --> 03:06:10.333
Pushpa will take over.

03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:20.583
Turn on all the monitors.

03:06:23.583 --> 03:06:25.250
My name is Pushpa.

03:06:26.333 --> 03:06:27.541
Pushpa Raj.

03:06:27.666 --> 03:06:30.541
- Sir, the camera is this way.
- Then move it over here.

03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:33.625
No further introduction is needed
to my name.

03:06:33.708 --> 03:06:34.916
So, I'll get straight to the point.

03:06:36.625 --> 03:06:37.791
How dare you kidnap her?

03:06:38.125 --> 03:06:39.875
How dare you kidnap my daughter?

03:06:40.541 --> 03:06:42.416
Are you really that brave?

03:06:42.833 --> 03:06:43.708
Hey!

03:06:44.166 --> 03:06:45.291
You morons!

03:06:46.708 --> 03:06:49.583
Now, listen up closely.

03:06:49.791 --> 03:06:52.875
I'll give you an hour from now.

03:06:54.291 --> 03:06:57.625
Bring my beloved back
to where you took her from.

03:06:58.458 --> 03:07:03.541
{\an8}It should be as if she just
returned from her computer class.

03:07:04.625 --> 03:07:09.458
If my child comes back
with even a little scratch on her…

03:07:12.416 --> 03:07:16.166
I'll hack each of you mercilessly

03:07:16.250 --> 03:07:20.666
like sacrificial goats
at the Gangamma fair.

03:07:20.791 --> 03:07:26.458
I'll hack you all mercilessly!

03:07:26.625 --> 03:07:28.833
This should play on all channels
till the girl comes home.

03:07:31.916 --> 03:07:34.541
You've heard Pushpa's warning
to the kidnappers.

03:07:42.125 --> 03:07:43.000
Hey!

03:07:43.666 --> 03:07:45.416
Listen carefully.

03:07:45.791 --> 03:07:48.291
I gave those morons one hour.

03:07:48.916 --> 03:07:51.666
But you have only 30 minutes
to find my child.

03:07:53.125 --> 03:07:58.833
Search every road, lane, and by-lane.
Cover the entire Chittoor district.

03:07:58.916 --> 03:08:00.458
Don't leave out an inch.

03:08:00.583 --> 03:08:02.458
{\an8}Set up a check post at every corner.

03:08:02.541 --> 03:08:03.375
ANDHRA PRADESH
POLICE

03:08:04.625 --> 03:08:08.000
Whether it's a police car or
a politician's, if you suspect something,

03:08:08.083 --> 03:08:09.583
stop and check the vehicle.

03:08:09.666 --> 03:08:14.208
I'm closing Chittoor's borders
until my child is found.

03:08:15.541 --> 03:08:17.875
I'm halting all movement.

03:08:21.541 --> 03:08:25.708
Until my child returns,
the government doesn't rule this district!

03:08:27.541 --> 03:08:29.166
It's Pushpa's rule.

03:08:54.041 --> 03:08:54.958
{\an8}Sir!

03:08:55.375 --> 03:08:56.291
Greetings!

03:08:57.291 --> 03:08:59.083
Why the sudden appearance?

03:08:59.458 --> 03:09:02.000
Have you got any idea
what's going on in Chittoor?

03:09:02.208 --> 03:09:03.625
Chittoor…

03:09:03.833 --> 03:09:07.541
Someone abducted Pushpa's
beloved girl. He's burning with rage.

03:09:07.625 --> 03:09:09.083
It's not just "someone."

03:09:09.625 --> 03:09:12.500
- It's my nephew, Bugga Reddy.
- What are you saying?

03:09:12.583 --> 03:09:14.875
The only heir to our Kogatam family.

03:09:17.291 --> 03:09:20.083
He gambles with all the money
my brother and I earn.

03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:24.541
He was arrested for rape recently
but was released on bail.

03:09:24.625 --> 03:09:26.625
- Hey, dude!
- Hey!

03:09:27.416 --> 03:09:29.125
Kesava, put Pushpa on the phone.

03:09:30.083 --> 03:09:31.041
Macha, it's the CM.

03:09:36.500 --> 03:09:37.416
Sir.

03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:41.666
Central Minister Pratap Reddy's nephew
took the girl.

03:09:41.875 --> 03:09:43.291
That moron!

03:09:44.083 --> 03:09:45.125
Is it?

03:09:45.958 --> 03:09:48.458
Then call up Pratap Reddy

03:09:48.708 --> 03:09:51.791
and tell him my child
should be returned unscathed.

03:09:52.208 --> 03:09:55.500
If not, I'll have to kill him.
Lives will be lost for no reason.

03:09:55.625 --> 03:09:58.250
Hey, Pushpa!
What are you talking about?

03:09:58.916 --> 03:10:01.333
I'm asking you
not to get involved in this.

03:10:01.958 --> 03:10:04.875
But you never truly
saw each other as brothers.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:05.875
Why are you doing all this now?

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.166
But my child always
considered me her uncle.

03:10:09.166 --> 03:10:11.625
She must be waiting for me to rescue her.

03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:22.791
She called me "Uncle" several times,
but I couldn't answer her calls.

03:10:24.083 --> 03:10:27.250
If I don't respond now,
what value would that call hold?

03:10:27.333 --> 03:10:31.208
Pushpa, do you have any idea
who you're locking horns with?

03:10:32.916 --> 03:10:36.083
You think Pratap Reddy got to the top
just by mining?

03:10:36.375 --> 03:10:38.958
He buried anyone
who stood in his way to the top.

03:10:39.291 --> 03:10:42.708
If he decides, will either
you or I even survive?

03:10:43.083 --> 03:10:44.041
Really, sir?

03:10:45.916 --> 03:10:49.875
- Would it be such a huge problem?
- Yes, man! That's what I'm saying!

03:10:51.916 --> 03:10:54.416
So… what do you suggest I do?

03:10:55.125 --> 03:10:57.958
{\an8}Let go of this matter, man.
Why get into this mess?

03:10:58.916 --> 03:10:59.875
{\an8}Abandon her?

03:11:00.958 --> 03:11:01.916
{\an8}Yes, Pushpa.

03:11:02.333 --> 03:11:04.416
{\an8}- That's what's best for all of us.
- Alright, sir.

03:11:05.666 --> 03:11:06.541
I'll leave her.

03:11:07.333 --> 03:11:08.250
Alright then.

03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:17.250
To hell with Pratap Reddy!
To hell with Prabhu Reddy and his brother!

03:11:17.416 --> 03:11:19.041
Even the Central Minister!

03:11:19.666 --> 03:11:21.250
None of them matter to me!

03:11:22.041 --> 03:11:25.500
And you? Are you some Chief Minister
telling me to abandon my child?

03:11:25.583 --> 03:11:26.583
Let go!

03:11:29.166 --> 03:11:32.208
If they harm my child in any way,

03:11:32.958 --> 03:11:37.000
tell Pratap Reddy they won't even
find a scrap of their bodies.

03:11:39.625 --> 03:11:40.833
Damn you!

03:11:42.958 --> 03:11:45.750
What kind of Chief Minister is he
to ask me to abandon the girl?

03:11:45.833 --> 03:11:47.291
I unnecessarily made him the CM.

03:11:47.958 --> 03:11:49.458
To hell with them!

03:11:49.791 --> 03:11:54.291
{\an8}"To hell with Siddappa! To hell with
Pratap Reddy! To hell with everyone!"

03:11:57.083 --> 03:11:57.958
Brother.

03:11:58.625 --> 03:12:00.416
Pushpa is sure to kill Bugga Reddy.

03:12:00.916 --> 03:12:03.000
He controls all of Chittoor.
Even I'm helpless.

03:12:04.250 --> 03:12:07.250
We must find Bugga before
Pushpa does. Call your brother.

03:12:07.375 --> 03:12:09.083
Hey, Prasad! Call up Subba Reddy!

03:12:09.208 --> 03:12:11.958
I know his usual hideouts, brother.
I'm going there.

03:12:14.083 --> 03:12:15.041
What's the matter?

03:12:15.416 --> 03:12:16.291
Hey.

03:12:19.333 --> 03:12:24.916
I'll hack each of you mercilessly
like sacrificial goats.

03:12:25.083 --> 03:12:26.708
Bro! The girl is awake.

03:12:27.208 --> 03:12:30.333
- If you begin, Kranti and I will--
- Hey!

03:12:31.458 --> 03:12:34.500
Don't do anything to the girl.
She cannot be harmed.

03:12:34.708 --> 03:12:36.750
What's up, Bugga?
Are you scared?

03:12:38.166 --> 03:12:39.166
Just a little.

03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:46.416
Brother.
It's me who kidnapped that girl.

03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:47.666
It's me.

03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:50.333
I'll unleash hell on all of you!
Where's the girl?

03:12:50.625 --> 03:12:53.750
Brother, we had no idea
the girl was related to Pushpa.

03:12:53.833 --> 03:12:55.958
- We just saw it on TV.
- Whose call is it?

03:12:56.166 --> 03:12:58.291
- Since he too is involved…
- Track the location.

03:12:58.375 --> 03:13:00.708
we called you thinking you'd
give the money and take her.

03:13:00.791 --> 03:13:02.916
Where the hell are you guys?
Where do we meet you?

03:13:03.083 --> 03:13:04.666
We don't trust anyone.

03:13:06.625 --> 03:13:10.041
I want to speak to Pushpa directly.
Put him on the phone.

03:13:10.125 --> 03:13:12.833
- Hey, this is Pushpa. What is it?
- Brother.

03:13:12.916 --> 03:13:13.875
Nothing, brother.

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.041
We did it due to a dire need for money.

03:13:16.125 --> 03:13:18.000
- Please don't think otherwise.
- Find out where they are.

03:13:18.583 --> 03:13:19.708
Place. Ask for the location.

03:13:19.791 --> 03:13:23.833
What's 20 million for you?
Give us 100 million for the girl, brother.

03:13:25.291 --> 03:13:28.000
- Where do you want me to come?
- Inform the pilot to come.

03:13:28.125 --> 03:13:29.041
Where should I come?

03:13:29.125 --> 03:13:33.083
I'll tell you. But don't tell anyone.
And you must come alone.

03:13:33.250 --> 03:13:36.375
Hey! I mean every word
I'm saying right now.

03:13:36.666 --> 03:13:39.000
If I find so much as
a scratch on my child,

03:13:39.083 --> 03:13:43.000
I will take all your heads without mercy!

03:13:47.500 --> 03:13:48.916
Start the bikes, guys!

03:13:52.625 --> 03:13:54.916
You guys go towards Chittoor.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.416
Mother Gangamma will take care
of what is right and what is wrong.

03:13:57.750 --> 03:14:01.291
If anything happens to the girl,
make sure that none of them…

03:14:03.958 --> 03:14:04.833
is spared.

03:14:05.125 --> 03:14:06.208
See you.

03:14:06.750 --> 03:14:08.750
Macha, tell us the location!
Macha!

03:14:18.250 --> 03:14:19.958
We are at the Annamayya circle now.

03:14:20.041 --> 03:14:24.208
Mulleti Mohan Rao,
Kaveri's father, has just arrived.

03:14:24.583 --> 03:14:25.791
What are the kidnappers' demands?

03:14:25.875 --> 03:14:29.208
{\an8}What is he up to? What's going
to happen? Stay tuned to Siti Cable.

03:14:30.541 --> 03:14:32.041
Brother, cheer up.

03:14:32.333 --> 03:14:36.041
Your daughter will be back
before that knife touches your head.

03:14:36.125 --> 03:14:37.875
Who do you think
has gone to bring her back?

03:14:37.958 --> 03:14:39.208
- Pushpa.
- Hey!

03:14:39.458 --> 03:14:41.958
- Is there a sale in Tirupati?
- Why, man?

03:14:42.083 --> 03:14:44.208
The elder one is shaving his head,
and the younger one is coming to rescue.

03:15:34.916 --> 03:15:38.916
- Where's my daughter?
- Will you send a note? She's inside.

03:15:39.291 --> 03:15:42.125
But there's a gun pointed at the girl.

03:15:43.333 --> 03:15:46.166
If you fire here,
the gun will go off there.

03:15:47.500 --> 03:15:49.208
- Hey, Puli!
- Brother.

03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:51.041
Fire the gun once.

03:15:56.666 --> 03:15:58.250
That was in the air, brother.

03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:00.875
If you hurry…

03:16:01.375 --> 03:16:02.916
- he'll aim for the head.
- Step out!

03:16:04.041 --> 03:16:05.375
Get off!

03:16:05.833 --> 03:16:06.833
Leave!

03:16:08.916 --> 03:16:10.875
Pratap Reddy's nephew.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.416
You can't be doing this just for cash.

03:16:16.416 --> 03:16:17.708
What do you really want?

03:16:18.416 --> 03:16:20.791
Look, man!
Pushpa has figured it out!

03:16:22.958 --> 03:16:25.000
No one becomes a big shot just like that.

03:16:25.791 --> 03:16:30.083
Nothing, brother. The boys are upset
about getting beaten up at the festival.

03:16:30.958 --> 03:16:35.000
Money can fix needs,
but can it ever erase humiliation?

03:16:35.791 --> 03:16:38.291
Let's beat him up, Bugga.
We'll get even.

03:16:38.625 --> 03:16:40.375
He can then safely take his child.

03:16:40.458 --> 03:16:42.166
- What say, boys?
- Yes, brother!

03:16:45.666 --> 03:16:48.083
Why isn't he retorting?

03:16:49.708 --> 03:16:51.875
Brother loves his child a lot.

03:16:52.458 --> 03:16:53.875
That's why he's silent.

03:16:54.583 --> 03:16:55.458
Hey!

03:17:03.791 --> 03:17:06.541
That day, he was all dressed up
when he beat us up.

03:17:07.041 --> 03:17:08.916
Today, it feels like a different person.

03:17:09.541 --> 03:17:10.583
It doesn't feel the same.

03:17:11.375 --> 03:17:12.250
Is that so?

03:17:14.541 --> 03:17:15.666
- Hey!
- Bro.

03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:18.541
- Go to the deity and bring that sari.
- Okay.

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.625
What's up, Bugga?
Did you call me to kill someone here?

03:17:41.916 --> 03:17:43.208
Hey! What's all this?

03:17:44.041 --> 03:17:45.375
Is this real currency?

03:17:46.583 --> 03:17:47.625
- Oh, my!
- Bro.

03:17:47.875 --> 03:17:49.125
What's the matter?

03:17:49.208 --> 03:17:50.666
- Greetings, brother.
- Greetings.

03:17:51.958 --> 03:17:52.916
Who's this?

03:17:53.250 --> 03:17:54.416
Why is he dressed up like this?

03:17:58.166 --> 03:17:59.125
Pushpa!

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:07.125
What have you done?

03:18:07.708 --> 03:18:09.333
Do you have any idea
who you are messing with?

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000
You are this close to death!

03:18:13.083 --> 03:18:14.500
Get back!

03:18:16.583 --> 03:18:17.500
Sorry, brother.

03:18:17.916 --> 03:18:19.416
The boys made a mistake.

03:18:21.875 --> 03:18:23.875
Pushpa has the entire state in his pocket.

03:18:24.666 --> 03:18:26.833
Do you think you'd still be alive
if you dared to harm him?

03:18:35.708 --> 03:18:38.333
Hey, bring the ropes.
Tie him up!

03:18:38.666 --> 03:18:39.708
Hold his arms.

03:18:39.791 --> 03:18:41.250
Do you have any idea
how dangerous he is?

03:18:42.500 --> 03:18:43.458
Hey!

03:18:43.666 --> 03:18:46.416
You jackasses invited your own death!

03:18:46.500 --> 03:18:48.791
Hey, Dhamma.
Simply tying up his hands isn't enough.

03:18:48.875 --> 03:18:50.875
Have you forgotten what you saw
in the forest that day?

03:18:54.125 --> 03:18:55.666
Tie up his legs! His legs!

03:18:56.041 --> 03:18:57.375
Tie them up!

03:18:58.208 --> 03:18:59.208
Fast.

03:18:59.583 --> 03:19:01.583
- Harder.
- He's too scared.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:06.541
He's still conscious.

03:19:06.625 --> 03:19:09.541
Hey! His hands and feet are tied.
What can he even do now?

03:19:09.625 --> 03:19:13.083
As long as he's drawing breath,
he'll take ours away!

03:19:13.166 --> 03:19:14.291
Give me a knife.

03:19:16.208 --> 03:19:18.708
- Hold on, man.
- What?

03:19:19.541 --> 03:19:20.958
How can we just kill him?

03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:24.041
The real fun begins now.

03:19:24.750 --> 03:19:25.958
Hey, Puli!

03:19:26.166 --> 03:19:28.583
- Brother.
- Bring the girl.

03:19:41.666 --> 03:19:42.875
Lift him up.

03:19:59.625 --> 03:20:00.541
Uncle!

03:20:01.208 --> 03:20:02.166
Uncle!

03:20:05.416 --> 03:20:06.541
Uncle!

03:20:15.125 --> 03:20:16.083
Dear…

03:20:19.791 --> 03:20:21.708
are you alright?

03:20:22.500 --> 03:20:25.833
Pushpa, I already told you
that she is alright!

03:20:26.041 --> 03:20:30.458
She's exactly as she was
when we brought her here.

03:20:34.083 --> 03:20:35.541
He doesn't believe us. Hey!

03:20:35.958 --> 03:20:37.250
Remove her sari and show him.

03:20:37.500 --> 03:20:41.791
The other day, he beat us up badly
for simply pulling her sari.

03:20:41.916 --> 03:20:45.875
- Let's see what he does now.
- No, don't do it.

03:20:47.333 --> 03:20:48.666
Here, I'm taking it off.

03:20:48.791 --> 03:20:49.875
Putting it back.

03:20:49.958 --> 03:20:52.041
Taking it off. Putting it back.

03:20:52.625 --> 03:20:55.291
Taking it off. Putting it back.

03:20:55.541 --> 03:20:58.000
Hey, stop!
Not up there, Bugga.

03:20:58.250 --> 03:21:00.625
I think he suspects
we hurt her somewhere else.

03:21:00.708 --> 03:21:02.416
- Hey, lift her sari.
- Okay, bro.

03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:05.166
Hey! Stop.

03:21:10.291 --> 03:21:11.250
What did you say?

03:21:12.166 --> 03:21:14.041
If you find so much as
a scratch on your child,

03:21:15.041 --> 03:21:18.666
you will take all our heads without mercy?

03:21:34.916 --> 03:21:36.916
Uncle!

03:22:06.666 --> 03:22:07.541
Hey!

03:25:20.666 --> 03:25:22.041
No mercy!

03:25:27.291 --> 03:25:30.208
No mercy!

03:25:54.250 --> 03:25:56.125
No mercy!

03:26:04.166 --> 03:26:05.916
Putting it in! Taking it off!

03:26:06.041 --> 03:26:07.041
Putting it in!

03:26:07.375 --> 03:26:08.291
Taking it off!

03:26:08.458 --> 03:26:10.208
Putting it in! Taking it off!

03:26:10.791 --> 03:26:11.708
Putting it in!

03:26:25.708 --> 03:26:27.375
No mercy!

03:26:32.083 --> 03:26:34.375
No mercy!

03:26:45.208 --> 03:26:47.750
Hey, Kesava.
You remember what I said, right?

03:26:47.875 --> 03:26:48.958
Yes, sir. I remember.

03:26:55.416 --> 03:26:58.625
I'm telling this for the sake of Pushpa
and his safety. Understand?

03:26:58.708 --> 03:26:59.750
Yes, sir.

03:27:00.958 --> 03:27:03.583
No mercy!

03:27:05.333 --> 03:27:07.166
Hey, Samba!

03:27:07.916 --> 03:27:09.708
Kesava, you need to stop this at any cost.

03:27:09.791 --> 03:27:11.666
Yes, sir.
Girl, are you alright?

03:27:13.208 --> 03:27:16.000
Stop, macha!
Please listen to me!

03:27:16.083 --> 03:27:18.083
- I won't spare you!
- Let's talk this out.

03:27:26.458 --> 03:27:30.666
Macha! Let him go.
Our girl is fine. Right?

03:27:30.750 --> 03:27:33.208
Please listen to me, macha!

03:27:34.166 --> 03:27:37.166
- Uncle, stop! Let go of him!
- I won't spare you!

03:27:37.291 --> 03:27:38.333
Uncle!

03:27:40.083 --> 03:27:42.416
- Uncle! Uncle!
- Macha! Macha!

03:27:42.500 --> 03:27:43.666
- Uncle!
- Macha!

03:27:44.041 --> 03:27:44.916
Macha!

03:27:50.708 --> 03:27:52.500
Get up! Go away!

03:27:53.375 --> 03:27:56.916
CM sir, Bugga Reddy is fine.
Ask Mr. Pratap Reddy to relax.

03:27:57.041 --> 03:27:59.208
Put Bugga on the phone.
Pratap Reddy wants to speak to him.

03:28:11.041 --> 03:28:12.041
CM sir…

03:28:12.416 --> 03:28:15.333
Bugga Reddy is going away.
Call back after five minutes.

03:28:15.416 --> 03:28:16.875
What happened?
Hey, Kesava!

03:28:16.958 --> 03:28:20.666
Whoever it is,
if they lay a hand on a girl…

03:28:21.625 --> 03:28:23.125
No mercy!

03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:25.083
Bugga!

03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:27.125
No mercy!

03:28:29.791 --> 03:28:32.458
Never backing down!

03:28:37.291 --> 03:28:40.958
You!

03:29:16.583 --> 03:29:19.666
You killed my son just for her, right?

03:29:20.083 --> 03:29:21.416
I'll take her away.

03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:25.041
- I'll sleep with her every day.
- Uncle!

03:29:25.125 --> 03:29:26.708
Do what you can!

03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:31.208
No mercy!

03:29:33.458 --> 03:29:35.083
- Narayana!
- Narayana!

03:29:35.166 --> 03:29:36.625
- Narayana!
- Narayana!

03:29:36.708 --> 03:29:38.291
- Narayana!
- Narayana!

03:29:38.375 --> 03:29:39.708
- Narayana!
- Narayana!

03:29:40.666 --> 03:29:41.875
Give it to those seated inside.

03:29:45.791 --> 03:29:49.083
I told Pushpa. He'll talk to
the collector and get your work done.

03:29:49.375 --> 03:29:51.208
Why come all the way here
for trivial matters?

03:29:52.625 --> 03:29:53.625
Hey, move.

03:29:54.708 --> 03:29:55.583
No, no!

03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:03.625
Come, brother.

03:30:07.333 --> 03:30:08.250
Give it, I'll hold it.

03:30:15.333 --> 03:30:17.166
- Auntie!
- What is it?

03:30:33.666 --> 03:30:36.000
What are you looking at?
Ask him to come in.

03:30:36.625 --> 03:30:38.666
- Mohan! Come here.
- Come.

03:30:39.250 --> 03:30:40.583
Please come in. Sit.

03:30:42.416 --> 03:30:43.875
Srivalli. Call Pushpa.

03:30:44.541 --> 03:30:46.208
Lachi, bring some water.

03:30:46.666 --> 03:30:47.583
Sit, dear.

03:30:59.375 --> 03:31:01.708
Dear, your brother is here.

03:31:03.375 --> 03:31:05.208
I mean… your relative is here.

03:31:20.083 --> 03:31:21.083
Here.

03:31:28.041 --> 03:31:30.416
Mother, it looks like
he won't be coming.

03:31:40.375 --> 03:31:41.291
He won't come.

03:31:42.833 --> 03:31:43.833
Why would he?

03:31:46.291 --> 03:31:47.833
Even if he does, how can I face him?

03:31:50.916 --> 03:31:52.041
I've hurt him so much.

03:31:55.250 --> 03:31:56.750
I denied him our surname as a child.

03:31:58.750 --> 03:32:00.125
But he lived on like an orphan.

03:32:03.833 --> 03:32:05.083
When he came to see Dad
for one last time,

03:32:06.333 --> 03:32:08.208
I pushed him away
without considering he was just a kid.

03:32:10.500 --> 03:32:11.791
Even during his engagement…

03:32:14.666 --> 03:32:16.041
instead of taking up a responsible role,

03:32:17.833 --> 03:32:20.000
I insulted his birth by saying--

03:32:20.708 --> 03:32:22.583
- Oh, no!
- Stop it! What are you doing, son?

03:32:22.666 --> 03:32:23.708
Why bring all this up now?

03:32:23.791 --> 03:32:24.666
Mother…

03:32:27.541 --> 03:32:28.458
after all that I've done…

03:32:29.708 --> 03:32:31.083
how can I face him?

03:32:34.541 --> 03:32:35.916
Dad always used to say…

03:32:38.083 --> 03:32:39.041
that he's my brother,

03:32:39.791 --> 03:32:40.833
a child.

03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:43.958
"Take care of him when I'm gone," he said.

03:32:47.125 --> 03:32:48.125
But what have I done?

03:32:49.416 --> 03:32:50.541
I never considered him my brother.

03:32:51.875 --> 03:32:52.916
I looked at him as an enemy.

03:32:55.500 --> 03:32:56.375
But he…

03:32:57.000 --> 03:32:58.875
took responsibility for my daughter
when she was in trouble.

03:33:00.166 --> 03:33:01.791
He put his life on the line to save her.

03:33:04.666 --> 03:33:08.000
He fought a battle just because
she called him "Uncle."

03:33:13.291 --> 03:33:16.291
After all, it's a blood relation.
How could he ignore that?

03:33:25.958 --> 03:33:26.916
I'm the elder son.

03:33:28.041 --> 03:33:28.916
And you are the mother.

03:33:29.708 --> 03:33:30.625
Please forgive me.

03:33:34.458 --> 03:33:35.708
I'm saying this in front of Dad.

03:33:37.708 --> 03:33:38.958
Oh, no!

03:33:39.041 --> 03:33:40.958
- Get up, Mohan.
- Forgive me, Mom!

03:33:41.083 --> 03:33:43.250
- What is this? Get up!
- Please forgive me.

03:33:45.125 --> 03:33:46.166
What is this?

03:33:47.666 --> 03:33:50.250
Actually, Kaveri's wedding has been fixed.

03:33:51.958 --> 03:33:56.541
I got the wedding cards printed
and came here right away.

03:34:00.583 --> 03:34:02.083
I'm handing over the first card to you.

03:34:17.541 --> 03:34:20.541
Your granddaughter is firm
that she won't get married

03:34:20.625 --> 03:34:22.166
- if her uncle doesn't come to the wedding.
- Oh, my!

03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:27.000
We'll distribute the cards to others
only if you agree to come to the wedding.

03:34:27.333 --> 03:34:29.333
Don't say that.
It is your daughter's wedding.

03:34:29.708 --> 03:34:30.583
Yes, dear.

03:34:30.708 --> 03:34:32.458
He's full of pride.

03:34:32.708 --> 03:34:34.416
He hasn't even come to see you.

03:34:34.750 --> 03:34:36.625
There's a chance
he won't attend the wedding.

03:34:37.666 --> 03:34:40.333
The Mulleti family is celebrating
something together for the first time.

03:34:42.291 --> 03:34:43.500
How can it happen without him?

03:34:45.291 --> 03:34:46.708
Tell him his brother invited him.

03:34:48.291 --> 03:34:49.166
He'll surely come.

03:35:20.208 --> 03:35:21.833
Dear, check this out.

03:35:22.583 --> 03:35:26.250
"With the blessings of
Shri Mulleti Parvathamma."

03:35:27.416 --> 03:35:29.583
They printed the wedding card
in your mother's name.

03:35:32.541 --> 03:35:33.708
And look at this.

03:35:34.458 --> 03:35:36.333
{\an8}"Sons and daughters-in-law."

03:35:36.750 --> 03:35:40.333
{\an8}"Mr. Mulleti Pushpa Raj
and Mrs. Srivalli."

03:35:44.083 --> 03:35:47.916
They got all the names right
but forgot one.

03:35:50.958 --> 03:35:54.416
The name of Mulleti Chinna Venkataramana.

03:36:04.583 --> 03:36:05.541
Dear!

03:36:06.125 --> 03:36:07.125
Dear!

03:36:12.208 --> 03:36:13.083
Dear!

03:36:13.416 --> 03:36:14.541
Son…

03:36:15.333 --> 03:36:18.083
- Pushpa.
- Dear…

03:36:22.625 --> 03:36:23.583
Pushpa…

03:36:31.958 --> 03:36:34.333
- What happened, dear?
- Pushpa…

03:36:39.041 --> 03:36:39.958
Don't cry.

03:36:48.250 --> 03:36:49.666
THE MULLETI FAMILY'S WEDDING CELEBRATION

03:37:04.708 --> 03:37:05.583
Welcome.

03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:48.708
- How are you, Mother?
- I'm doing good.

03:37:53.458 --> 03:37:54.750
- Come on.
- Let's go.

03:37:55.833 --> 03:37:56.750
- Come.
- Come on.

03:38:47.458 --> 03:38:48.333
Uncle!

03:38:58.916 --> 03:39:00.416
Can I call you "Auntie" now?

03:39:08.916 --> 03:39:10.666
Father, put this on him.

03:40:10.208 --> 03:40:11.583
All are here.

03:40:12.916 --> 03:40:13.958
But where's the actual one?

03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:17.041
Didn't he come?

03:40:17.291 --> 03:40:19.375
The person isn't here, sir.
But we did receive his message.

03:40:55.666 --> 03:40:56.541
What's wrong?

03:40:56.625 --> 03:40:58.250
- Hey, what happened?
- What's wrong, vadina?

03:40:58.541 --> 03:41:01.625
Your dad is dancing with joy from inside.

03:41:03.791 --> 03:41:04.750
Dad!

03:41:05.375 --> 03:41:09.750
From now on, we'll never back down.
