June 26, 1993

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.464
Exactly 40 years after the
release of the movie Devadas.

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:43.315
How many times have I asked you
not to watch old movies, Sai Ram?

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:44.701
Why don't you ever listen?

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:49.200
-I want a baby like Devadas.
-That is exactly what I fear.

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:51.339
-Sairam...
-Huh?

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:57.667
People wish for a child who writes
like Kalidas, or sings like Yesudas

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:01.239
-but an alcoholic like Devadas?
-Sairam...

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.003
One can achieve anything in this
world using either brawn or brain.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.504
And that can be due to one's upbringing
or can be cultivated individually.

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:14.548
But... to have a heart that is as
pure as Devadas's and to be able to

00:02:14.748 --> 00:02:18.206
captivate others' heart is
something one can only be born with.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:25.041
I wish to give birth to a boy
who is as great a lover as Devadas.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.073
Ah! Ah!

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.500
Oh goodness! Not a peep from him.
What would have happened to him?

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:48.029
There isn't even a doctor at hand.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:50.958
I wonder who is going
to rescue this baby now.

00:02:56.056 --> 00:02:59.379
The baby boy born in ward number 9
isn't breathing and has no pulse.

-Sir, sir...
-One minute... wait...

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.344
-isn't the baby delivered yet?
-Just stay put.

00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:10.914

Boy,
look like Tendulkar's strong cricket bat.

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.846
-What are you doing?
-Hey, get up!

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:23.733
[laughs]

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.839
You have to get up now and should hit 4.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.506
Get up.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:33.306
You have to get up and hit a 6.

[infant crying]

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:48.760
He is not out.

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:54.831
Call him.

00:03:55.108 --> 00:03:56.217
Devadas.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:57.821
Come on, dear.

00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:01.341
Come on, dear.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:02.815
What's that Vanitha,

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:05.315
The boy seems to be dull.

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:06.815
You should have seen him
when he was born grandma.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.607
I have been seeing him since his birth.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:11.166
He is as dim as the
bed light in the bedroom.

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:13.990
Sairam...

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.291
Hey, what did you name the
boy? And what did you put here?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:19.791
Put what you are supposed to.

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:21.916
What else am I supposed to put?

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.041
This...

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
He will come now.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.375
Hey, wait. Nothing will happen...

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.339
It's alright, leave it!

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:38.949

00:04:57.567 --> 00:04:58.157
Husband...

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.593
Come on, Devadas.

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:17.262
-Devadas...
-Come on, dear.

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.920
Ah?

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.608
Health problems have
been coming since birth

[cicadas chirping]
-Let's get to the big doctor?

00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:37.358
Okay, let's take tomorrow morning

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:40.154
[clock ticks]

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.892
Dear, where is the boy?

00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:55.598
[inhales]

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:10.150
As per these reports,
your son has 'Fetal Alcoholic Syndrome'.

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:12.858
And it is in the final stage.

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:16.066
-What...
-What does that mean, sir?

00:06:16.358 --> 00:06:20.150
If the woman consumes too much
alcohol while she is pregnant,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.358
it is likely that children
are born with this disorder.

00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:23.650
-Nothing like that...
-Nonsense!

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:25.525
My wife drinking alcohol?

00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:27.914
No one from our family has this habit.

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:30.335
Well, it is impossible
to hold one particular...

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:33.295
...reason as the root
cause of the disease.

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:35.920
But the symptoms of your boy,

00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:39.691
are most certainly those
of Fetal Alcohol Disorder.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.207
Children with this
disorder eventually lose sight

00:06:43.407 --> 00:06:44.769
and their mental
function slows down as well.

00:06:45.983 --> 00:06:49.608
Eventually, the nervous system
becomes weak and the pulse rate weakens.

00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:52.199
That is the reason why they
appear to be in an aberrated state.

00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:54.067
How do you treat it?

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:58.876
There is no treatment for
Fetal Alcoholic Disorder.

00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:01.775
But you are in luck.

00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:05.060
Your boy's body responds to alcohol.

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:10.129
So, the only medication
for your son is alcohol.

00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:16.483
Put 2 drops of alcohol in 2 ml of
water and feed it to him thrice a day.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.233
And with the increase in
age, increase the dosage.

00:07:19.483 --> 00:07:23.275
How can we feed the boy alcohol when he
is a baby who is supposed to be fed milk?

00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:28.816
Listen, some people like to drink
alcohol. For some, it is a habit.

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:31.150
And yet for some
others, it's an addiction.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.066
But for your son, it is a necessity.

00:07:34.983 --> 00:07:39.691
If he misses out on even one
dosage, it could be fatal to him.

00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:45.275
I am going to give him a doctor's
certificate as an authorized drinker.

00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:01.525
Darling, this is yours.
Only you have to drink it.

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.566
When the alarm goes
off, you must consume it.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.587
-Is that clear?
-You've already told me numerous times.

00:08:05.787 --> 00:08:06.532
I know what to do.

00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:08.358
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Hey...

00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:09.983
The District Educational Officer
(DEO) is coming here for an inspection.

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:12.733
I will be able to hold on to my
post only if you guys answer correctly.

00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:15.275
-What is 15 times 3?
-45, sir.

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:17.275
W-hat is 45 times 2?
-90, sir.

00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:18.797
-2 times of 90?
-Quarter (180 ml), sir.

00:08:19.008 --> 00:08:20.592
Oh goodness!
I beg you please sit over there.

-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.670
Good morning, sir.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.576
Sit down. Sit down.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.900
Boy, you there, stand up.

00:08:31.358 --> 00:08:35.900

Boy patterns, let's try something else.

-Sir... please...Sir...
-What ?

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.182
-Let's talk inside, sir.
-What is your nuisance?

00:08:50.482 --> 00:08:53.191
Sir, the thing is my son
drinks alcohol and it's time...

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.608
Do you have any sense?

00:08:54.983 --> 00:08:56.162
10th Class Exam is going on here...

00:08:56.354 --> 00:08:57.550
-Leave! Get out!
-Sir, please...

-There is still time...

00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:42.400
-You can still write down.

-[shouts]
[glass bottle clinks]

00:11:45.066 --> 00:11:47.275
Hey! You are on our side.
Why are you hitting our people?

00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:48.158
Huh!

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.983
Our side, our county, our division,
our district, discotheques in Delhi.

00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:54.113
I don't know any of those.

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:57.014
When I hear the word 'Help', I forgot
all boundaries and proceed forward,

00:11:57.214 --> 00:11:58.078
thrashing the other side.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.566
I don't harbour any
feelings of kinship or region.

00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:02.358
Do you even know why we are thrashing him?

00:12:02.608 --> 00:12:03.900
Whatever may be the reason.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.066
It's wrong to gang up on a single
person like that. It's very wrong.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.233
We asked him on the day of the
engagement if he had any bad habits?

00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:12.773
He said no.

00:12:12.973 --> 00:12:15.336
But he began drinking at his bachelor's
party at 3 pm yesterday afternoon.

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:17.066
He stopped drinking just a few
minutes before the wedding ceremony.

00:12:17.358 --> 00:12:18.400
He is a heavy drinker.

00:12:20.691 --> 00:12:22.316
-Well then, he deserves thrashing.
-That is why we were thrashing him.

00:12:22.566 --> 00:12:24.355
-Bash him guys.
-But on one condition.

00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:29.273
If there is anyone amongst you who
hasn't ever touched a drop of alcohol,

00:12:29.473 --> 00:12:30.743
only that person can hit him.

00:12:40.483 --> 00:12:42.608
What happened to the
city? Why is no one talking?

00:12:43.108 --> 00:12:43.900
Hey, Roll Reddy...

00:12:44.275 --> 00:12:45.650
what's in the menu at the evening party?

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.900
50 bottles of Alcohol and
100 cases of beer, buddy.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.858
Really?

00:12:49.108 --> 00:12:50.473
So, you mean to say all the people
who come for the wedding can drink

00:12:50.673 --> 00:12:51.598
except the bridegroom?

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:53.108
What kind of rules are those?

00:12:53.358 --> 00:12:54.276
You go and tie the
sacred matrimonial thread.

00:12:54.376 --> 00:12:54.927
Thank you, brother.

00:12:55.227 --> 00:12:55.875
Hmm...

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.428
That's good.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.412
There is a limit for everything.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.719
If you consume liquor within your limit,

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:04.705
your body will function like
an engine on full throttle.

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:06.355
So, be in limits.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.066
Tell me that limit?

00:13:08.525 --> 00:13:09.125

-Mr. Devadas, you are appointed.
-Thank you, sir.

00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:19.235
What is this smell?

00:17:20.316 --> 00:17:23.388
Sir...
Didn't you see the last certificate?

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.292
Authorized drinker certificate?

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.477

-Sir, I take 3 pegs of alcohol every day.
-3 pegs?

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:37.275
Yes, sir. 90 ml each in the
morning, evening and night.

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:39.941
Sorry, Mr. Devdas.

00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:42.900
Sorry, Mr. Devdas.

00:17:44.525 --> 00:17:45.358
Sorry, Mr. Devdas.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.275

A young man named Devadas rescued a
four-year-old boy who had taken his life

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:57.441
The video is now viral on social media

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.075
I thought it was just a traffic
jam. Now, there is power cut as well.

00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:07.126
At this rate,
I doubt if we would reach home.

00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:29.798
It looks like an angel has descended
from heaven and is clearing the traffic.

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.525
Hi, Mr. Devadas.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.983
Hi, Mr. Devadas.

00:20:00.316 --> 00:20:01.154
How are you?

00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:03.291
How do you know me?

00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:07.670
You saved that little boy,
right. You are awesome... Superb.

00:20:08.358 --> 00:20:08.958
Thanks.

00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:10.441
You are really great, sir.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.941
Why are you clearing the traffic here?

00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:17.672
It's just a part of service
concern towards the society.

00:20:18.108 --> 00:20:21.838
-Then you are quite awesome yourself.
-Thank you.

00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:24.705
Hello... oh, green signal there, go...

00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:27.627
Oh, the traffic is jammed. Go on.

00:20:27.858 --> 00:20:28.582
-Bye, Mr. Devadas.
-Wait we are going.

00:20:28.682 --> 00:20:30.871
Stop staring, move!
-Very Nice meeting you, bye.

00:20:31.527 --> 00:20:32.595
Go, please go.

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.274
Move.. Move.. go!

00:20:39.358 --> 00:20:43.146
Hey buddy, you are looking up at the
stars and smiling to yourself like that.

00:20:43.483 --> 00:20:45.691
Have you stepped on some voodoo stuff?

00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:49.632
-Rollu...
-Tell me, buddy.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.759
Ever since I saw that
girl at the traffic signal...

00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:56.588
My heart and my lips seem to
be in conflict with each other.

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:59.350
Buddy... Buddy...
[laughs]

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.108
Anyways, why don't you give me some
advice on how to approach that girl?

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:03.245
Hmm...

00:21:04.275 --> 00:21:07.408
Since that girl praised
you for saving that boy.

00:21:07.983 --> 00:21:09.941
I am sure she must have
shared that video on Facebook.

00:21:10.191 --> 00:21:12.941
Roll Reddy. You have a brain too.

00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:14.816
Wait a minute. Let's check for it.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.887
Devadas, who saved a boy.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.165
Buddy, she posted that video.

00:21:24.608 --> 00:21:25.117
Is that so?

00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:35.313
So that means...
that was our first meeting.

00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:38.993
The girl's name is 'Suvasana'.

00:21:39.193 --> 00:21:39.862
What smell?

00:21:40.483 --> 00:21:41.645
Suvasana!

00:21:43.645 --> 00:21:45.833
Hey, she is a physiotherapist.

00:21:46.072 --> 00:21:47.315
Oh, you mean a doctor for the bones.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.047
Idiot. Physiotherapist does not
mean a doctor for the bones.

00:21:49.247 --> 00:21:49.723
Oh, is it?

00:21:51.108 --> 00:21:53.419
Hey, she also uploaded another video.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:58.650
Because of the chemical waste
released from this Janvik factory,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.691
the people around here are being
subject to severe health problems.

00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:07.821
Her beauty is very captivating and she
has a heart that wishes everyone well.

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:11.028
What more do I need to love her?

00:22:11.694 --> 00:22:13.988
Make her a friend request. Come on.

00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:15.563
Yeah. Where is my phone?

00:22:19.809 --> 00:22:22.380
Hey... she has already
sent me a friend request.

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.983
Accept it. Accept her friend request.

00:22:26.556 --> 00:22:30.691
Buddy... these days, compared to boys,
girls are the ones to make the first move.

00:22:31.275 --> 00:22:32.559
What are you waiting for? Proceed.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:33.514
-Hi...
-Hi!

00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:35.906
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, no job.

00:22:36.006 --> 00:22:38.091
Don't Worry you get a job very soon.

00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:38.691
-Hey!
-Hmm?

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:40.252
Don't you have the sense
to give me some privacy?

00:22:40.352 --> 00:22:42.483
Hey! Why don't you give her
your number and take her's as well?

00:22:42.583 --> 00:22:43.463
You can speak to each other directly.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.650
May be its too soon to ask for her number.

00:22:47.125 --> 00:22:48.275
Well, let me tell you.

00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:52.566
I solemnly swear on the alcohol
that is favoured by millions of people.

00:22:52.775 --> 00:22:54.733
If you give her your number
she will give you her number.

00:23:03.275 --> 00:23:06.319
What is this? As soon as I sent
her my number she went offline.

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:09.900
May be because it's night. Perhaps she
will give you her number in the morning.

00:23:13.968 --> 00:23:16.682
Useless fellow! How could you
advise me to text her my number?

00:23:16.918 --> 00:23:18.138
-How could you joke around like that?
-Don't hit me!

00:23:19.748 --> 00:23:20.657
[cuckoo coos]

00:23:22.885 --> 00:23:26.258
[snoring]
[cuckoo coos]

00:23:30.483 --> 00:23:32.988
Unnecessarily sent her the number...

00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:37.419
-Oh my god!
-Useless fellow!

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:38.880
-You ruined everything giving stupid idea!
-You, idiot!

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.827
Did you step on a horse this
morning? Why did you kick me?

00:23:43.574 --> 00:23:46.999
[chants]

00:23:47.275 --> 00:23:48.483
Hello brother. My name is Raja Reddy.

00:23:50.858 --> 00:23:54.816
The child you rescued yesterday
was mine. I am in your debt.

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:56.941
It's not a big deal. Please sit down.

00:24:00.393 --> 00:24:01.023
Here, have it dear.

00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:11.729
I have seen mothers who make
tea or coffee for their children,

00:24:11.829 --> 00:24:14.424
his is the first time that I am seeing
a mother who fixes her son a drink.

00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:15.715
[bell rings]

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.400
He must have done something
really great in his previous life.

00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:20.775
May be that is why he is
born with this kind of luck.

00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:21.625
Sairam!

00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:24.233
Sairam... Sairam...

00:24:24.733 --> 00:24:25.707
-Listen, brother.
-Sir?

00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:29.592
Your father told me all about
you. Will you work for me?

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.530
You get job very soon...

00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:36.042
I most certainly will, sir.

00:24:36.242 --> 00:24:38.552
I have a huge wine
shop near the city centre.

00:24:38.902 --> 00:24:41.175
If you are ok with it, I will
employee you as it's manager.

00:24:42.483 --> 00:24:44.333
My son will certainly take it up. He will.

00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:45.608
What do you mean he will take it up?

00:24:46.108 --> 00:24:49.637
My son is an MBA gold medallist.
Why would he work in a wine shop?

00:24:49.837 --> 00:24:50.374
Mother...

00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:53.598
Dignity of labour.
It doesn't matter what job it is.

00:24:54.307 --> 00:24:58.045
I must have been blessed by an angel I
got a job without having to ask for it.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.128
Who knows if it's because of a blessing
or due to chatting on the messenger?

00:25:01.898 --> 00:25:03.475
-This is my wine shop.
[indistinctive voices]

00:25:03.862 --> 00:25:06.088
I'll be back in
sometime. Take care of the shop.

00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:08.688
[indistinctive voices]

00:25:18.652 --> 00:25:21.518
Excuse me, brother.
Give me 180ml of whisky.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.207
I asked for whisky.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.450
I asked for 180ml.

00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:36.367
You seem to have
trouble focusing on your job.

00:25:36.925 --> 00:25:37.742
Be careful.

00:25:39.009 --> 00:25:40.867
As if you are buying
me a drink! Move aside.

00:25:41.067 --> 00:25:41.848
[sighs]

00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:44.308
Oh no! Why I disturbed like this...

00:25:48.842 --> 00:25:50.405
Here is the stock.

00:25:54.217 --> 00:25:54.931
That person is Seshu.

00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:56.700
He is the one who supplies alcohol.

00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:01.222
This is Devadas.
He has come here to work in our shop.

00:26:01.842 --> 00:26:03.508
What is this? Why are you tuck
your shirt like a professional?

00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:06.370
Are you here to work at a wine
shop or at a software company?

00:26:07.259 --> 00:26:08.084
Remove your tuck.

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:10.722
Come on, do it.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.278
Sheshu...

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:15.337
Do your business.

00:26:15.925 --> 00:26:17.544
Hey... unload it.

00:26:21.175 --> 00:26:22.664
What is with this haste
as if you are dying to pee?

00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:23.806
-Be careful with the stock.
-Okay, brother.

00:26:27.675 --> 00:26:29.103
-Sir, this alcohol is adulterated.
-Hey!

00:26:30.134 --> 00:26:31.774
Shut your mouth, public is here.

00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:34.427
Sir, this is alcohol is adulterated.

00:26:34.742 --> 00:26:35.762
How can you tell?

00:26:36.592 --> 00:26:37.569
Sir, you know about me.

00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:39.850
I can tell you the percentage of alcohol
in the product just by smelling it.

00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:43.401
This is a hundred percent
NSA. Non-Rectified Spirit.

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:44.786
The stock is completely adulterated.

00:26:45.183 --> 00:26:46.697
Seshu, I have told you numerous times.

00:26:46.967 --> 00:26:48.272
I don't sell
adulterated alcohol in my shop.

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:50.703
I am asking you to load
your stuff back up and leave.

00:26:50.903 --> 00:26:54.354
I never take back the
stock that has left my gates.

00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:57.666
I am the one who supplies
liquor to the entire city.

00:26:58.759 --> 00:27:00.960
No one has ever complained.
Why do you have a problem?

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.841
I will not tolerate the
sale of adulterated liquor.

00:27:04.467 --> 00:27:05.605
Do what you want to.

00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:12.296
You must have seen a vehicle
that runs on petrol or even diesel.

00:27:12.771 --> 00:27:14.639
But I run on alcohol.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.499
If I dash you, you will not exist.

00:27:32.224 --> 00:27:32.712
Hey!

00:27:32.929 --> 00:27:33.480
[glass bottle breaks]

00:27:33.922 --> 00:27:35.436
[glass shatters]

00:27:37.499 --> 00:27:38.204
Hey!

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.007
Ah!

00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:04.382
Hey!

00:28:07.205 --> 00:28:08.024
Hey! Ah!

00:28:17.547 --> 00:28:21.459
Till now I hit everyone...
but you are the one who hit me.

00:28:22.842 --> 00:28:24.288
Today is yours.

00:28:24.675 --> 00:28:25.917
I'll see your end...

00:28:26.634 --> 00:28:29.409
Not just today. Any day for that matter,

00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:30.527
I will be the one throwing the last punch.

00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:39.868
Why is she not coming
online from yesterday?

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.858
What's with you? Why do you keep
looking at your phone so often?

00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:45.883
What's in your phone?

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:53.409
You are the one who made a mess
and you ask me, 'what's wrong?!'

00:28:54.425 --> 00:28:55.145
You seem to have it easy.

00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:56.992
If your love story is a
hit, friends are called gods.

00:28:57.217 --> 00:28:58.717
And if your love story goes to
flop, friends will be blamed.

00:28:58.913 --> 00:29:00.372
Stop your drama.
You are the reason for all this mess.

00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:02.135
All my friends are morons like you!

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.380
-Hello?-This is Suvasana speaking.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.900
-What Vasana (smell)?
-Suvasana, sir.

00:29:08.217 --> 00:29:12.025
Su... Su... Su... Suvasana.

00:29:12.467 --> 00:29:14.692
Hello, Suvasana madam. Tell me.

00:29:15.425 --> 00:29:18.396
Could you please come
to my house tomorrow?

00:29:19.417 --> 00:29:22.676
To house it seems? For what?

00:29:22.876 --> 00:29:26.442
I told my parents about you.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.184
My father wishes to speak to you.

00:29:30.384 --> 00:29:32.359
Okay, I will be there.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.525
-Where is the address?
-I will share the location on WhatsApp.

00:29:39.884 --> 00:29:41.670
-Bye.
-Alright. Thanks.

00:29:42.571 --> 00:29:43.205
[phone rings]

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:47.400
Manikonda, Saraswati
Colony. Do we know anyone there?

00:29:48.217 --> 00:29:50.184
One of my college
friend lives in that colony.

00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:52.166
He is a very social guy..
who gets along with Housewives,

00:29:52.469 --> 00:29:53.453
socially drinking husbands...

00:29:53.842 --> 00:29:56.268
little kids in nurseries
and even college going girls.

00:29:56.516 --> 00:29:58.984
He'll be in touch with
everyone. His name is 'Rapo Ravi.'

00:30:05.634 --> 00:30:06.434
-Hi, uncle.
-Hi.

00:30:06.634 --> 00:30:07.184
Where is aunty?

00:30:07.384 --> 00:30:08.549
-She is in the house taking a shower.
-Is it?

00:30:08.758 --> 00:30:09.412
Let me go wish her.

00:30:09.634 --> 00:30:10.772
Hey! Hey! Hold on... Hold on...

00:30:10.972 --> 00:30:12.246
You and your efforts to
build rapport. Get away.

00:30:12.346 --> 00:30:13.352
I will come by when you are not around.

00:30:14.467 --> 00:30:14.996
Hi buddy.

00:30:15.364 --> 00:30:17.019
Rollu... how come you
remembered me after so long?

00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:18.896
Not Motor and pestle. It's Rollu Reddy.

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:19.771
Alright, fine.

00:30:20.136 --> 00:30:21.808
Anyways, this is my friend.

00:30:22.008 --> 00:30:23.043
-He is a part of my soul.
-Hi.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:23.714
Devdas...

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:25.345
He has fallen in love
with a girl from your colony.

00:30:25.842 --> 00:30:26.758
Our colony?

00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:30.622
I doubt if there is an
eligible girl in our colony.

00:30:30.946 --> 00:30:32.404
-Her name is Suvasana.
-[gasps]

00:30:32.604 --> 00:30:33.408
That girl?

00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:34.814
Why did you make that face?

00:30:35.217 --> 00:30:36.763
If we were to discuss their
family, it would become a thesis

00:30:36.963 --> 00:30:38.009
and can be made into a web series as well.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.099
They were presented with the award
'Noble family with global thoughts.'

00:30:42.199 --> 00:30:43.484
Hey! It's an award-winning family.

00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:46.740
They are the epitome of
respect and social responsibility.

00:30:47.009 --> 00:30:48.668
What do we generally call our mothers?

00:30:49.175 --> 00:30:50.515
-Mom.
-Right?

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:53.993
But they call their
mom as lady of the house.

00:30:54.634 --> 00:30:55.932
Are they daughters or maid servants?

00:30:56.175 --> 00:30:57.059
Everyone has the same confusion.

00:30:57.259 --> 00:31:00.390
They are vegetarians and teetotallers.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:03.806
Our guy here is a hardcore
non-veg and drinks three times a day.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:06.359
-Alcohol?
-Yes.

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.348
That is the one thing that
that family cannot tolerate.

00:31:08.732 --> 00:31:09.242
Alcohol.

00:31:10.884 --> 00:31:12.335
That is an anti-alcoholic family.

00:31:12.535 --> 00:31:14.956
In order to avoid the smell
when their neighbours booze...

00:31:15.433 --> 00:31:17.261
he planted flowering
plants all around their house.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.905
And even that fragrance was not
enough to stop the smell of booze...

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.273
so, that idealistic person named
his daughter Suvasana (fragrance).

00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:28.579
Before you enter their house, the
smell of alcohol in you reaches them...

00:31:28.815 --> 00:31:29.878
...and your love story
ends even before it begins.

00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:30.987
Gates wouldn't open.

00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:34.960
-Buddy, what do we do?
-You can only enter after he leaves.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:36.970
Stop the vehicle.

00:31:37.842 --> 00:31:40.442
Brother, where is this girl's house?

00:31:50.134 --> 00:31:53.126
This looks like a feisty
group. If we go along with them,

00:31:53.326 --> 00:31:55.258
the chances of our alcohol
breath getting caught will be slim.

00:31:55.358 --> 00:31:57.109
-Do you know the address or not?
-I'll show you.

00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:17.079
Hey, this is her house.

00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:21.740
Wow! Such a nice house.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.121
[birds chirping]

00:32:24.467 --> 00:32:24.895
Brother!

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.880
This is the house.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.667
Even before you enter their house, the
smell of alcohol on you reaches them...

00:32:34.867 --> 00:32:37.418
...and your love story
ends even before it begins.

00:32:37.618 --> 00:32:38.166
Oh!

00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:39.700
-[caughs]
-Ah!

00:32:48.134 --> 00:32:49.415
Mother...

00:32:50.415 --> 00:32:52.780
-Father...
-What happened?

00:32:54.092 --> 00:32:55.912
Something stinks.

00:32:58.342 --> 00:32:59.100
Yes, Rao sir.

00:33:02.514 --> 00:33:04.332
This is also called as alcohol smell.

00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:05.693
Thank you, brother.

00:33:05.893 --> 00:33:07.070
-Okay brother.
-See you.

00:33:07.342 --> 00:33:09.578
You told me that we
would go along with them.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.997
Whoever arrives first will become the
culprit. We are going to be safe then.

00:33:13.197 --> 00:33:15.738
-Oh!
-Yeah!

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.411
Why did you tie those
things around your faces?

00:33:19.611 --> 00:33:23.984
Do you know John Wick?
Did you hear about him?

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.379
Your daughter has uploaded a
post on Facebook claiming...

00:33:29.034 --> 00:33:31.057
...that Brother John Wick's
chemical factory needs to be closed.

00:33:33.217 --> 00:33:36.788
We are here to warn her in person.

00:33:37.384 --> 00:33:39.415
If you repeat this ever again...
[fingers snapping]

00:33:40.036 --> 00:33:42.603
I am going to demolish your
house and post that in Facebook.

00:33:43.967 --> 00:33:44.913
Let's go guys.

00:33:45.342 --> 00:33:45.958
Hey...

00:33:50.887 --> 00:33:51.792
Meet you soon brother.

00:33:54.384 --> 00:33:55.020
Start...

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.567
[Singing random Telugu song]

00:33:59.767 --> 00:34:01.399
Hey, Tulasi leaves... just a pause.

00:34:04.015 --> 00:34:04.483
[laughs]

00:34:09.373 --> 00:34:10.085
Now no one can smell it.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.223
Hi, Devasadu sir.
Please come. Please come in.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.917
Please come. Please come in.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.525
-Hi uncle...
-Let's have some breakfast.

00:34:18.884 --> 00:34:20.508
That's alright, sir. I already had mine.

00:34:20.813 --> 00:34:21.635
Come on now.

00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:26.736
Hi, Devasadu sir.

00:34:26.891 --> 00:34:27.939
Hi, I came a while back,

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.448
but saw some patients of
Suvasana's coming in and waited outside.

00:34:30.648 --> 00:34:32.067
They are not patients.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.975
They are Goons.

00:34:34.175 --> 00:34:35.593
They have come here to deliver a warning.

00:34:36.175 --> 00:34:36.767
Warning?

00:34:36.967 --> 00:34:38.692
Goons are came to our
house to threaten us?

00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:41.817
Why did you let them go?
You should have thrashed them.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.850
What can they do?

00:34:44.634 --> 00:34:47.650
My mom and dad worked in RSS.

00:34:48.217 --> 00:34:49.547
If my mom had a stick in her hand,

00:34:49.747 --> 00:34:51.797
she would have thrashed
the hell out of 25 people.

00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:53.059
Is that true?

00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:54.480
There were only 5 or 6 of them.

00:34:54.752 --> 00:34:57.521
If that's the case,
my mom is not required.

00:34:57.721 --> 00:34:58.860
My little sister is
enough to finish the job.

00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:00.680
What can she do?

00:35:01.009 --> 00:35:03.806
My little sister is a
master in martial arts.

00:35:04.009 --> 00:35:09.984
If she gives her famous flying kick
five of them would have severe injuries.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.517
My youngest daughter is Aveshita.

00:35:12.717 --> 00:35:13.567
Aveshita?

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.525
Young man, you saved that young child.

00:35:20.987 --> 00:35:22.142
I am very impressed.

00:35:22.342 --> 00:35:22.892
Thank you, sir.

00:35:23.092 --> 00:35:26.946
This is the minimum social responsibility
people of this days and age need to have.

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.543
You helped an unknown person.

00:35:30.967 --> 00:35:33.248
We can only imagine how well you
take care of your near and dear ones.

00:35:41.225 --> 00:35:42.623
By the way, where do you work?

00:35:42.884 --> 00:35:44.701
-Wine shop.
-All: In a wine shop!

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:49.725
Not a wine shop. In Vines App.

00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.116
Wine shop... Vines App.
What do these things mean?

00:35:53.316 --> 00:35:54.565
Couldn't you have looked for a proper job?

00:35:54.928 --> 00:35:56.269
I am going to change jobs soon, uncle.

00:35:56.933 --> 00:35:57.916
Oh God! Oh no, I can't stand with them!

00:35:58.842 --> 00:36:01.466
Miss. Suvasana,
you need to figure out an auspicious day

00:36:01.666 --> 00:36:03.376
and enter our house with your right foot.

00:36:04.759 --> 00:36:06.806
What I meant was,
my mom has sprained her back

00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:08.635
you need to come down
and give her a session.

00:36:08.929 --> 00:36:09.694
Oh... back pain.

00:36:09.794 --> 00:36:13.107
Why only the right foot?
She needs to use both of her feet.

00:36:13.307 --> 00:36:14.890
Really? Let's do that.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.631
Why look for an auspicious
day? Let's go right now.

00:36:21.175 --> 00:36:22.266
This is my house.

00:36:23.388 --> 00:36:23.936
Mom...

00:36:25.134 --> 00:36:25.821
Hello aunty.

00:36:26.592 --> 00:36:27.987
-Mom, this is Suvasana.
-Greetings.

00:36:28.187 --> 00:36:29.042
-She is our...
-Where is the pain aunty?

00:36:29.242 --> 00:36:29.596
Oh no!

00:36:31.259 --> 00:36:34.181
You have sprained your back, haven't
you? She is a physiotherapist.

00:36:34.467 --> 00:36:36.783
Dr. Suvasana. She has
come here to treat you.

00:36:37.009 --> 00:36:39.975
Why does your house stink?

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.374
There is a new spray called
'Mansion House'. We've been using it.

00:36:44.134 --> 00:36:44.748
It doesn't smell nice.

00:36:53.908 --> 00:36:55.024
What is this, son?

00:37:02.458 --> 00:37:03.760
[shouting in pain]

00:37:04.384 --> 00:37:05.974
Wow, what a performance.

00:37:06.866 --> 00:37:09.338
Mr. Devadas, don't you think
there is a mismatch between...

00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:11.255
...your mom's reactions and the
areas my sister is focusing on?

00:37:11.592 --> 00:37:14.364
Even you guys could figure that
out. Don't you think she would know?

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.484
Your mom seems to think she is
doing a fabulous job. So, let her.

00:37:17.484 --> 00:37:19.339
-[shouts]
-Oh no! What happened?

00:37:19.634 --> 00:37:20.830
-Back pain.
-Since when?

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.746
Call the doctor.

00:37:22.134 --> 00:37:22.933
Sairam!

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:23.955
Uncle...

00:37:26.842 --> 00:37:28.546
she is not in great pain.
Don't worry, it will reduce.

00:37:35.467 --> 00:37:37.730
What is this?
Why is this room filled with bottles?

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.269
[caughs]
[steel glass clinks]

00:37:39.634 --> 00:37:42.540
We have decorate the
room with all those bottles?

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.789
It will look quite good.

00:37:44.425 --> 00:37:45.163
Isn't looking good?

why we decorated it this way.

00:37:52.134 --> 00:37:53.462
This girl looks really cute.

00:37:54.384 --> 00:37:56.363
It's not a girl. It's a boy.

00:37:56.634 --> 00:37:58.439
My son. My darling.

00:37:59.384 --> 00:38:00.821
He looks really cute.

00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:03.250
He used to drink milk... But now...

00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:06.370
He is drinking decoction. Decoction...

00:38:07.821 --> 00:38:09.873
Hey, can't you control my mouth!

00:38:50.592 --> 00:38:52.225
"You just have to look
at me once, it's enough"

00:38:52.425 --> 00:38:54.109
"You just have to smile
at me once, it's enough"

00:38:54.342 --> 00:38:57.109
"You just have to take a
step with me, it's enough"

00:38:58.092 --> 00:38:59.725
"reply just once, it's enough"

00:38:59.925 --> 00:39:01.725
"Put a smiley in the

"Just give me a missed

"You just have to be with me"

00:39:09.967 --> 00:39:11.900
"I will not wish for any other blessings"

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:15.817
"You just have to be with me, it's enough"

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.650
"I will not wish for any other blessings"

00:39:21.009 --> 00:39:23.400
"It's enough, enough, enough"

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:27.275

-What is that?
-It's a guava leaf.

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:28.059
Why do you always chew that?

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:32.267
It has calcium, magnesium,
phosphorous The doctor told me so.

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:33.442
Alright, fine. Let's go.

00:40:36.675 --> 00:40:40.689
"Every morning,
you start my day by changing your DP,"

00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:43.966
"and that's enough"

00:40:44.634 --> 00:40:48.256
"It's doesn't matter even if the
sunlight and the moonlight come and go,"

00:40:48.456 --> 00:40:51.486
"I am always in the love light"

00:40:52.592 --> 00:40:55.817
"It's just enough if you
come to the coffee shop"

00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:59.609
"It's enough if you
come to the movie theatre"

"I want just this much,

Did you not see the way he spoke?

00:42:40.134 --> 00:42:40.659
Get down.

00:42:42.759 --> 00:42:44.169
Buddy, Vasana is coming.

00:42:46.342 --> 00:42:48.578
-No, I don't think so.
-Idiot, I meant Suvasana.

00:42:58.717 --> 00:42:59.500
-Hi..
-Hi..

00:42:59.884 --> 00:43:02.008
I am going to a village for treatment.

00:43:02.467 --> 00:43:04.596
If you are free, why don't you join me?

00:43:04.796 --> 00:43:06.161
How can I not accompany
you when you ask me to?

00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:08.184
-Which village?
-Pochampalli.

00:43:08.384 --> 00:43:09.848
-Ah...
-That is an ideal village.

00:43:10.425 --> 00:43:12.372
-That is an ideal village.
-Oh!

00:43:12.572 --> 00:43:13.957
Not a single person
in that village drinks.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.985
There isn't a single wine
shop in or around that village.

00:43:18.085 --> 00:43:18.485
Ah!

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.900
I need to make some
preparations before I join you.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.350
Hello...

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.859
No, it's not necessary.

00:43:26.217 --> 00:43:29.359
It's just 15 kilometres.
We will be back before evening.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.900
I don't think he will be able
to survive until the evening.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.084
[gasps]

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.928
I didn't do it wantedly.

00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:54.609
It was sudden...

00:43:55.717 --> 00:43:57.025
-Because of sudden break...
-Can we have coconut water?

00:44:17.592 --> 00:44:19.949
Hey you! Stop right there... stop.

00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:22.151
If you want money, I will give it to you.

00:44:22.351 --> 00:44:24.352
-Please stop and give me back the bag.
-Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:44:24.475 --> 00:44:25.984
-What's in that bag?
-There is Sprite.

00:44:26.936 --> 00:44:27.984
-Sprite?
-Yes.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.663
Stop it. I will buy it for you.

00:44:30.925 --> 00:44:32.400
I want only that Sprite.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.000
-Hey, move man! Move fast...
-Mr. Devadas...

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:35.765
-Please stop.
-Move! Move!

00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.690
You look like you'll run 30 kilometres
for something that costs 30 rupees.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:41.244
Get on.

00:44:41.759 --> 00:44:43.121
-The thing is....
-Get on.

00:44:45.489 --> 00:44:45.813
Ok.

00:44:59.442 --> 00:45:00.108
-Buddy, tell me.
-Hey!

00:45:00.425 --> 00:45:02.934
Rollu buddy, just buy a bottle
of alcohol and start immediately.

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:03.987
I will share the location.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:05.101
What happened?

00:45:06.509 --> 00:45:08.225
I don't have the time nor the patience
to explain the entire story to you.

00:45:08.425 --> 00:45:09.434
Just shut up,
buy the bottle and come here.

00:45:09.634 --> 00:45:10.434
Alright. I am coming. I am coming.

00:45:54.675 --> 00:45:55.232
Mr. Devadas?

00:45:55.432 --> 00:45:57.106
[siren wailing]
[tires screeching]

00:45:57.306 --> 00:45:59.879
[life support machine beeps]

00:46:00.107 --> 00:46:00.650
Hmm...

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.559
This patient seems to have
irregular heartbeat and pulse.

00:46:04.842 --> 00:46:07.567
The liver seems to be on
vacation and the kidneys are protesting.

00:46:07.884 --> 00:46:11.671
All the organs of his body are
setting aside their basic functions

00:46:11.871 --> 00:46:14.302
and are keeping
themselves busy with other things.

00:46:14.502 --> 00:46:18.267
So, this person needs to be operated upon
urgently. If not, I doubt he will survive.

00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:19.934
-Operation?
-Operation, yes.

00:46:20.134 --> 00:46:20.934
Urgently.

00:46:21.175 --> 00:46:23.942
Dear, tell the doctor not to do
anything. We are starting right now.

00:46:24.342 --> 00:46:25.199
-Sairam. Let's go.
-Okay, move.

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:27.975
Doctor, his parents are asking
you to hold off until they arrive.

00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:30.649
Of course, I will wait.
But can the patient hold on?

00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:31.977
What if he dies in the mean time?

00:46:38.967 --> 00:46:40.582
Perform the operation.

00:46:52.439 --> 00:46:54.525
-Suvasana... Dear Suvasana!
-Doctor...

00:46:54.967 --> 00:46:56.400
-What happened?
-His parents are here.

00:46:57.259 --> 00:46:59.559
-Oh no... Aunty
-It's ok, no problem.

00:46:59.759 --> 00:47:00.434
It's ok, dear.

00:47:00.634 --> 00:47:02.609
-As per the reports...
-Just be quiet.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.642
Dear, just go and get
this medicine immediately.

00:47:05.842 --> 00:47:08.862
Hello... Hello...
I was the one who tested him.

00:47:09.062 --> 00:47:10.690
Yeah right, you only tested him.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.559
But we are the ones taking
care of him for the past 25 years.

00:47:12.759 --> 00:47:13.838
Dear... go.

00:47:14.467 --> 00:47:15.403
What's in this?

00:47:16.888 --> 00:47:20.517
Headache balm and Crocin tablets?
Do you know what's wrong with him?

00:47:20.717 --> 00:47:22.350
You are what's wrong with him.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.567
-Dear, you go on. Go.
-Go dear.

00:47:25.775 --> 00:47:27.141
Give it! Give it!

00:47:28.913 --> 00:47:29.313
Shut up!

00:47:32.746 --> 00:47:35.990
"90, 90, 90 ml..."

00:47:36.454 --> 00:47:39.338
"90, 90, 90 ml... "

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.717
[murmuring]

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:58.392
Hail Lord Venkateshwara.
Hail Lord Mallikarjuna.

00:47:58.592 --> 00:48:02.992
Hail the mountain Lord Narasimha!

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:07.809
He woke up.

00:48:08.009 --> 00:48:08.409
Ah?

00:48:08.675 --> 00:48:09.475
Doctor.

00:48:09.884 --> 00:48:10.684
Uncle...

00:48:10.925 --> 00:48:13.609
I am in the same situation as the doctor.

00:48:14.175 --> 00:48:15.895
Why did you use
headache balm as a talisman?

00:48:16.095 --> 00:48:17.668
And why did you mark
him with Crocin tablets?

00:48:18.009 --> 00:48:21.033
And how did Devadas
recover after your prayed?

00:48:21.233 --> 00:48:25.650
Ever since he was a child,
Devedas has had fainting spells.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:30.442
So, whenever he faint we
were advised by Amruta...

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.692
-Amrutanjana Swamy.
-Amrutanjana Swamy to do this.

00:48:38.967 --> 00:48:41.859
Well, it doesn't matter what it is.
I am glad that Mr. Devadas is alive.

00:48:42.384 --> 00:48:43.184
That's enough.

00:48:47.038 --> 00:48:48.567
Anyways, you guys managed very well.

00:48:48.767 --> 00:48:51.126
-We just got lucky.
-Stop... stop...

00:48:51.872 --> 00:48:53.920
-Breath out.
-Hello, uncle. Are you new here?

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.061
-I am new and so is my sir.
-Who is he?

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.022
Look. He is there.

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:03.576
Buddy, your uncle is a Sub-Inspector?

00:49:03.776 --> 00:49:04.979
-It's better to pay.
-Even I got to know now.

00:49:06.075 --> 00:49:07.408
Hello Devdas sir.

00:49:08.033 --> 00:49:09.069
-Hai sir.
-Hold this.

00:49:09.269 --> 00:49:12.844
Just like the crows on the electric line,
how did we end up in front of him?

00:49:13.044 --> 00:49:13.796
-Greetings.
-Hello Dasu sir.

00:49:13.996 --> 00:49:14.950
Are you coming from the office?

00:49:15.638 --> 00:49:16.454
What are you doing here?

00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:18.925
Very recently,
I have been transferred to this area.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:22.024
Does he look like an alcoholic?

00:49:22.224 --> 00:49:23.688
-Tell him to leave.
-ask him to blow on the breathalyzer sir.

00:49:24.158 --> 00:49:25.294
He is very strict officer!

00:49:25.583 --> 00:49:27.306
-Okay fine. Why deny you that pleasure?
-Blow.

00:49:29.832 --> 00:49:30.303
Blow sir.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:39.471
-What happen?
-Sir,

00:49:39.571 --> 00:49:40.738
that fellow threw the machine,
when asked him to blow sir.

00:49:42.117 --> 00:49:43.631
-Mr. Devadas, I'll come in a while.
-Okay, sir.

00:49:49.117 --> 00:49:49.954
Blow dear.

00:49:50.575 --> 00:49:52.946
-I am a minister's son.
-Blow dear.

00:49:53.146 --> 00:49:55.051
Don't you understand?
I am a minister's son.

00:49:56.933 --> 00:49:58.430
Buddy....

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:00.443
So, you drink and drive, is it?

00:50:01.408 --> 00:50:02.838
Who are you trying to kill?

00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:05.855
Buddy,
If he finds out about you,

00:50:06.055 --> 00:50:07.427
instead of giving
his daughter to you,

00:50:07.627 --> 00:50:08.476
He will hold your neck.

00:50:08.676 --> 00:50:09.385
Mr. Devadas!

00:50:10.117 --> 00:50:11.918
I am busy. You guys carry on.

00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:15.539
We are saved dude.

00:50:35.746 --> 00:50:37.464
Who is this? He looks like a hero.

00:50:37.739 --> 00:50:38.532
[laughs]

00:50:38.732 --> 00:50:41.210
This is nothing. There is a lot
more you will see in the future.

00:50:41.825 --> 00:50:42.417
Stay quiet.

00:50:42.617 --> 00:50:43.797
-Hey, John brother.
-Hey, Bojja.

00:50:43.997 --> 00:50:44.803
How are you, man?

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.200
-Yeah.
-Ha.. ha.

00:50:47.885 --> 00:50:49.812
Brother from a different mother.

00:50:50.012 --> 00:50:50.992
Jhon sir, greetings.

00:50:51.238 --> 00:50:53.559
Oh goodness.
You look super stylish brother

00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:56.388
Yeah, this is my new style.

00:50:56.588 --> 00:50:57.723
Latest trend!

00:50:57.923 --> 00:50:58.992
Yeah! Bojja.

00:50:59.242 --> 00:51:00.245
How come you change the trend?
[laughs]

00:51:00.867 --> 00:51:02.582
I'm just following you.

00:51:02.782 --> 00:51:04.274
Bojja... Hey Bojja.

00:51:04.474 --> 00:51:06.840
You know that right!
we were doing a venture in Shankarpalli?

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.947
Of course, I knew about it brother.

00:51:08.147 --> 00:51:09.809
We are constructing
villas in 500 acres of land.

00:51:10.075 --> 00:51:12.727
Yes. There is a 500 yards bit beside.

00:51:12.927 --> 00:51:15.997
That 500 acres of land, Bojja.

00:51:16.533 --> 00:51:18.846
Our partners are of the opinion
that if we can get hold of it,

00:51:18.946 --> 00:51:20.465
The perfect vastu would set.

00:51:20.732 --> 00:51:21.955
I offered to buy that
land from the owner...

00:51:22.305 --> 00:51:25.451
for more than 10 % of the market cost.

00:51:25.908 --> 00:51:28.331
But he refused my offer
He showed me his finger.

00:51:28.658 --> 00:51:30.024
And even warned me Bojja.

00:51:30.575 --> 00:51:32.687
He even challenged me Bojja.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.246
Who is that fellow?

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.666
He has the balls to stand up to you?

00:51:37.117 --> 00:51:38.270
I am going to kill him.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:42.941
Bojja! Cool... Cool... Cool!

00:51:45.563 --> 00:51:46.710
According to the book of Mathew...

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:48.848
Chapter five, 21st verse,

00:51:49.419 --> 00:51:51.120
I practice non-violence.

00:51:51.367 --> 00:51:55.434
You know that I don't like things
such as killings and murders, don't you?

00:51:56.908 --> 00:51:58.981
He threatened me with his finger.

00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:01.620
So, just remove that finger.

00:52:02.575 --> 00:52:04.162
He threatened me by
tapping his thigh, Bojja.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.199
So, cut that thigh away.

00:52:07.399 --> 00:52:08.796
That's a non-violence man.

00:52:08.996 --> 00:52:10.806
That not a big deal brother. We can do it.

00:52:11.006 --> 00:52:12.152
Okay, boys. Let's move.

00:52:12.352 --> 00:52:14.053
Bring our lads to the
pub in the evening.

00:52:14.253 --> 00:52:15.729
We will have a grand party there.
[Cheering]

00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:18.141
Brother, our lads are a
bit of country bumpkins.

00:52:18.341 --> 00:52:19.354
They are a rowdy bunch.

00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:20.696
I don't think Pub is their scene.

00:52:21.533 --> 00:52:22.996
Okay.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.394
It's ok. We will meet some other time.

00:52:25.594 --> 00:52:26.664
Bye guys, see you.

00:52:30.379 --> 00:52:31.065
What's up?

00:52:31.992 --> 00:52:33.781
Why are you guys look silent?

00:52:34.033 --> 00:52:35.099
What is this brother?

00:52:35.575 --> 00:52:38.705
Why didn't you agree when he
said he would take us to a pub?

00:52:38.905 --> 00:52:40.939
-He is a bit of a dangerous.
-You will say like this only.

00:52:41.039 --> 00:52:41.951
When he is drunk, he isn't human at all.

00:52:42.567 --> 00:52:43.957
I went once with him to the pub...

00:52:44.356 --> 00:52:48.501
[disco music]
[crowd cheering]

00:52:48.777 --> 00:52:50.294
Come on, Bojja. Come on.

00:52:50.598 --> 00:52:52.672
This is 20-20 match.

00:52:52.908 --> 00:52:53.916
What's this brother!

00:52:54.016 --> 00:52:56.621
-It's like country alcohol.
-Let's start the Tequila shots.

00:53:06.408 --> 00:53:09.013
Bojja, I am the winner.

00:53:09.641 --> 00:53:11.686
-No one can defeat you brother.
-Let's rock.

00:53:18.283 --> 00:53:19.099
Bojja...

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:23.656
Bojja,
I don't like the color of your shirt.

00:53:23.856 --> 00:53:26.539
It is clashing with
the lights of this place.

00:53:26.758 --> 00:53:27.445
Remove it Bojja.

00:53:28.825 --> 00:53:31.218
Please brother! a lot
of girls are there here.

00:53:31.318 --> 00:53:32.432
Bojja, then what now?

00:53:33.339 --> 00:53:33.872
Take my clothes.

00:53:34.367 --> 00:53:35.367
-Here.
-Ah?

00:53:36.867 --> 00:53:38.187
Brother...

00:53:38.907 --> 00:53:39.939
Fantastic brother.

00:53:44.839 --> 00:53:46.755
-Sleep, brother. Sleep.
-No, brother.

00:53:46.955 --> 00:53:48.657
You are my king.

00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:03.238
What are you doing here?

00:54:04.566 --> 00:54:07.721
Why are you here in my
bedroom on my bed and beside me?

00:54:07.921 --> 00:54:10.358
Brother, you were the one who told
that you want to share bed with me.

00:54:10.558 --> 00:54:12.812
I don't even break bread with anyone.

00:54:13.012 --> 00:54:14.834
How could I share my bed with you?

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:17.716
How dare you wear my clothes and my
chains and were sleeping beside me?

00:54:17.916 --> 00:54:20.413

00:54:26.992 --> 00:54:27.612
Why are you laughing your ass off...

00:54:28.077 --> 00:54:30.502
...when he used his
choicest words against me?

00:54:30.992 --> 00:54:32.439
It's so funny.

00:54:32.639 --> 00:54:35.306
By seeing his clothes,
we can say he is mad.

00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:36.699
He is not mad.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.561
He is a psycho.

00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:39.960
He forgets everything if he drink.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.591
Hey Amudam, she looks damn hot.

00:54:42.817 --> 00:54:44.763
-Stop stop.
-What happend brother?

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.250
She is so sexy dude.

00:54:55.533 --> 00:54:57.032
Brother, that girl?

00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:58.492
Didn't you go to her
place and threaten her?

00:54:58.692 --> 00:55:00.343
She is a physiotherapist. A doctor.

00:55:00.543 --> 00:55:02.052
-Physiotherapist?
-Yes.

00:55:02.367 --> 00:55:05.522
Ah, my back hurts.
I must have sprained my back.

00:55:06.246 --> 00:55:09.141
Call her up and tell her
to come home. Tell her.

00:55:09.341 --> 00:55:11.341
-Oh!
-[laughs]

00:55:11.718 --> 00:55:12.461
I'll call her, brother.

-Hello.
-Hello doctor.

00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:18.911
-My brother is in some serious pain.
-[panting in pain]

00:55:19.184 --> 00:55:20.734
Can you come home and treat?

00:55:20.992 --> 00:55:23.633
Listen,
if you don't have a doctor's reference,

00:55:24.075 --> 00:55:26.344
I will not come to
your place and treat you.

00:55:26.544 --> 00:55:27.226
Oh! god.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.580
-Stop acting.
-Ah?

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.074
She won't come home if
there is no doctor's reference.

00:55:31.274 --> 00:55:32.490
-Don't she?
-Hmm..

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.873
Call our doctor and inform him.

Shush...

00:55:42.331 --> 00:55:43.752
Oh, Ms. Suvasana. Tell me.

00:55:43.952 --> 00:55:44.888
Hi, Mr. Devedasu.

00:55:45.111 --> 00:55:46.486
-Hi.
-I...

00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:49.165
I am going to treat a
patient at their place.

00:55:49.365 --> 00:55:51.639
If you are free, will you join me?

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:53.651
Really? Why makes you think I
won't join you if you asked me?

00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:54.598
Where do you want me to come?

00:55:54.885 --> 00:55:56.859
You tell me where you are.I will come to you.

00:55:57.158 --> 00:55:58.244
Is it? I am at the office.

00:55:58.344 --> 00:56:01.085
It's at Charminar, Madina Bazaar,
Turn to the left and there's my office.

00:56:01.367 --> 00:56:02.558
Oh!

00:56:02.758 --> 00:56:03.582
I am right there.

00:56:04.283 --> 00:56:06.046
Oh goodness,
I gave her the wine shop address.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.411
Where?

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:11.959
-Hi!
-[gasps]

00:56:12.742 --> 00:56:15.297
Hi... where is your office?

00:56:15.558 --> 00:56:16.065
Office...

00:56:16.742 --> 00:56:18.319
This place stinks
because of the wine shop.

00:56:18.895 --> 00:56:19.679
Let's get out of here.

00:56:34.367 --> 00:56:36.707
Stop. Stop. Stop. This is the location.

00:56:38.607 --> 00:56:40.060
She brought some one with her!

00:56:42.179 --> 00:56:43.037
Brother...

00:56:53.742 --> 00:56:56.389
You are getting ready
to get on with that girl...

00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:58.881
You are preparing lot...

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.976
And that girl arrived here with a boy.

00:57:01.176 --> 00:57:01.724
Who is that fellow?

00:57:02.325 --> 00:57:04.890
It's the same guy who helped us with
her address the other day at her place.

00:57:05.408 --> 00:57:07.320
-He must be her boyfriend.
-Leave the guy behind

00:57:07.818 --> 00:57:08.825
and get the girl upstairs.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.084
-Namaste, doctor madam.
-Namasthe.

00:57:15.184 --> 00:57:16.119
I am the one who called.

00:57:16.792 --> 00:57:20.214
They are some two-bit
gangsters who came here to warn us.

00:57:21.542 --> 00:57:23.215
Madam, the patient is upstairs.

00:57:23.415 --> 00:57:24.775

00:57:24.975 --> 00:57:26.341

Can you shift here?

00:57:37.075 --> 00:57:40.168
No, madam. I cannot move.

I am in pain.

00:57:44.057 --> 00:57:45.743
-Okay.
-Oh lord.

00:57:47.117 --> 00:57:47.731
How is it here?

00:57:50.075 --> 00:57:51.073
What if I press here?

00:57:52.825 --> 00:57:53.363
How about here?

00:57:53.463 --> 00:57:55.136
My body seems to respond very weirdly

00:57:56.508 --> 00:57:58.302

[screaming]

00:58:20.199 --> 00:58:23.805
Hey! Don't treat the girl who
came to your house like a toy.

00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:25.703
Treat them as a sibling.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.513
-I will skin you alive.
[screaming]

00:58:29.866 --> 00:58:32.843
Brother, I thought you were
going to make the girl scream.

00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:34.377
Why are you screaming
instead? Have the tables turned?

00:58:34.658 --> 00:58:37.718
This doctor manhandled me.
Now, my back is sprained.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:39.480
What did you do to him?

00:58:40.075 --> 00:58:41.717
Don't shout. Don't shout.

00:58:42.158 --> 00:58:44.262
Beg her. She will only treat that way.

00:58:44.362 --> 00:58:48.160

anymore, that day I will treat you.

-Ha.

Mr. Devadas. Let's go.

00:58:59.146 --> 00:59:00.561
I heard a lot of noise
coming from upstairs.

00:59:00.867 --> 00:59:02.518
It's because of the
physiotherapy treatment.

00:59:02.825 --> 00:59:04.131
Such kind of pain and noise is common.

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:04.955
Let's go.

00:59:10.407 --> 00:59:12.139
Who does she think she is?

00:59:12.339 --> 00:59:14.240
There are many good doctors in Hyderabad.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.291
-I will take you to them. Let's go.
-[shouts]

00:59:16.833 --> 00:59:19.483
It doesn't look like a sprain. It looks
like you were purposefully broken.

00:59:19.583 --> 00:59:20.793
Doctor Suvasana did this to me.

00:59:21.041 --> 00:59:23.690
The person who broke you can
only be the one who can fix you.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:24.570
I cannot do anything.

I couldn't find a vehicle for your
size. So, I arranged this for you.

-Yeah, I'm going.

Call your sister, you..

01:00:35.742 --> 01:00:37.858
Hey!

01:00:38.908 --> 01:00:40.492
[groans]

01:00:41.983 --> 01:00:42.521
Who!

01:00:44.186 --> 01:00:46.121
-Haa!
-[shouts]

01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:49.658
Oh no!

01:00:50.969 --> 01:00:55.733
[groans]
[shouts]

01:00:55.979 --> 01:00:58.039
[laughs]
It's the summer, right?

01:00:58.239 --> 01:00:59.820
I think it's because of
excessive heat in the body.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.070
Brother, that doctor is coming.

01:01:03.281 --> 01:01:05.030
-Call her.
-Madam... Madam...

01:01:05.242 --> 01:01:06.703
My brother is in great pain.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:08.951
Please treat him,
madam. Please come, madam.

01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:10.527
Mr. Devadas. Please stay here.

01:01:10.992 --> 01:01:11.838
Two minutes brother.

01:01:12.158 --> 01:01:12.647
Come madam.

01:01:15.627 --> 01:01:17.913
-Come madam. Take a look at my brother.
-Sorry madam,

01:01:18.113 --> 01:01:20.555
I am a completely changed man.

01:01:20.908 --> 01:01:21.750
Please madam.

01:01:22.242 --> 01:01:23.985
I cannot take this pain anymore.

01:01:24.205 --> 01:01:28.026
Hey!
I can see nothing but lust in your eyes.

01:01:28.243 --> 01:01:28.997
-Please madam.
-Don't act!

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.450
Get lost! Get lost!

01:01:32.676 --> 01:01:34.514
Come on guys, start
the vechile. You idiot!

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.429
-Hey Aamu.
-Yes?

01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:46.944
Do I have that lust in my eyes?

01:01:47.044 --> 01:01:49.147
Brother, of course, yes.
You even look at me with lust.

01:02:01.055 --> 01:02:04.099
[tires screeching]

01:02:04.299 --> 01:02:06.367
[shouting]

01:02:14.516 --> 01:02:16.902
Hey! What's going on?

01:02:17.253 --> 01:02:19.749
The boyfriend of that doctor
has parked his bike in our way.

01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:20.368
Idiot...

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:22.901
Ask him why he do that.

01:02:27.741 --> 01:02:28.872
What's going on?

01:02:31.825 --> 01:02:34.758
That doctor's boyfriend
is mixing 90 ml in sprite.

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.564
Tell him to do it by the side of the road.

01:02:36.764 --> 01:02:38.342
What's the need for doing that across us!

01:02:51.075 --> 01:02:53.097
You are just having 90ml
peg. Why are you showing off?

01:02:53.297 --> 01:02:55.502
I have a full bottle. If I kick you once..

01:02:55.702 --> 01:02:57.382
[screams]

01:02:58.492 --> 01:02:59.285
What are you staring!

01:02:59.320 --> 01:02:59.970
Hey!

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:06.532
Hey!

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.325
-"90, 90!"
-Hey!

01:03:09.525 --> 01:03:10.408
Ah!

01:03:13.304 --> 01:03:13.827
Hey!

01:03:18.324 --> 01:03:18.756
Hey!

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:28.395
[groans]

01:03:42.266 --> 01:03:42.774
Hey!

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:44.435
Kill him with a punch...

01:03:53.617 --> 01:03:54.586
My back is cured.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:56.211
-My back is cured.
-Oh god.

01:03:56.548 --> 01:03:58.546
He has grown like an elephant
but has a brain the size of a rat.

01:04:05.431 --> 01:04:06.453
Why are you hitting us?

01:04:07.262 --> 01:04:08.837
Why are you hitting
us? Tell us the reason.

01:04:09.575 --> 01:04:11.931
Big sister, take a look at this video.

01:04:13.158 --> 01:04:15.135
Tell us why you are
hitting us and then hit us.

01:04:21.408 --> 01:04:22.681
Why are you hitting us?

01:04:22.905 --> 01:04:28.248
If the girl I am going to
marry gives you a warning,

01:04:28.873 --> 01:04:31.529
I suspect that something
fishy must be going on.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.001
He hit us based on a suspicion?

01:04:35.201 --> 01:04:37.042
What if he knew the actual truth?

01:04:37.142 --> 01:04:39.631
If I ever get to know that you guys have

01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:42.349
behaved improperly in
Doctor Suvasana's case,

01:04:43.165 --> 01:04:44.763
I will kill you on the spot.

01:04:45.793 --> 01:04:47.975
I am Devadas from Parvati Nagar.

01:05:09.852 --> 01:05:12.520
[phone rings]

01:05:13.533 --> 01:05:14.359
Hi, Suvasana.

01:05:15.617 --> 01:05:17.179
Why did you hit those goons up?

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:21.948
I felt that they were
at fault so, I hit them.

01:05:22.575 --> 01:05:23.247
I love you.

01:05:24.533 --> 01:05:25.955
Why? Because I hit those guys?

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:29.240
I love you.

"I have seen the heart
behind those rock-hard muscles."

01:07:02.897 --> 01:07:08.182
"I melted right then
and have mixed with you."

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:11.694
"I have seen your beauty, your curves"

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:14.792
"I have seen the
personality behind that beauty"

01:07:14.992 --> 01:07:20.029
"I have bowed down to it
and have succumbed to it"

01:07:20.696 --> 01:07:24.207
"The two of us today
have become three today."

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:28.926
"What?Three? Who is the third?"

01:07:29.126 --> 01:07:32.437
"The two of us today
have become three today."

01:08:00.638 --> 01:08:02.353
"All this time, I were single."

01:08:02.553 --> 01:08:04.029
"All this time, you were single"

01:08:04.129 --> 01:08:05.800
"Now it's time for us to mingle."

He apologised right.
Why are you hitting him?

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.588
Hitting him?
You will not be spared either.

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:07.583
If you think you can getaway just because

01:10:07.863 --> 01:10:09.795
you have the physique and
powerful people backing you,

01:10:09.993 --> 01:10:12.143
and start picking on someone or the other,

01:10:12.523 --> 01:10:13.942
you are in for a shock
when you meet people like me.

01:10:14.183 --> 01:10:16.969

You hit the person who hit me, bro.

01:10:29.687 --> 01:10:31.320
You are my friend, I love you.

01:10:32.944 --> 01:10:34.362
No... No... No way.

01:10:34.562 --> 01:10:35.890
We will have a big party.

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:37.645

Wow! You are a winner.

01:10:59.808 --> 01:11:01.040
What a stamina?

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.277
What is the secret of your stamina, bro?

01:11:03.477 --> 01:11:04.938
Secret, right? I shouldn't divulge it.

01:11:05.138 --> 01:11:06.883
Hey, bro.
[laughs]

01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:08.144
Amazing. Amazing!

01:11:08.392 --> 01:11:09.944
Okay. Let's go to my place.

01:11:10.144 --> 01:11:11.905
We will have a grand party. Come.

01:11:12.106 --> 01:11:13.049
Sir, it's alright. No.

01:11:13.265 --> 01:11:14.297
-Come on friend.
-Sir, my friend.

01:11:14.767 --> 01:11:16.716
-It's my party and it's my home.
-Sir, listen to me. Not like that.

01:11:20.426 --> 01:11:22.251

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:26.945
Come inside, my friend.

01:11:27.053 --> 01:11:29.739
Sir, it's better if you stay
out rather than come in.

01:11:29.975 --> 01:11:31.442
My boss is a very big psycho.

01:11:32.699 --> 01:11:33.835
Who is a psycho?

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:37.887
You take my money and
you talk shit about me?

01:11:39.111 --> 01:11:40.748
-Sir...
-Come on, my friend.

01:11:40.907 --> 01:11:42.996
Forget about all that nonsense.

01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:45.074
Oh! god.

01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:48.232
If he hit a ball out of the window,

01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:50.582
We need to play hockey with that one.

01:11:50.782 --> 01:11:53.330
[screams]

01:11:54.251 --> 01:11:56.435
Ramesh,
some sounds are coming from upstair.

01:11:56.535 --> 01:11:57.144
Come on, we will see.

01:11:57.344 --> 01:11:59.131
[groans]

01:12:01.142 --> 01:12:03.621
Instead of ball, how come a bat here.

01:12:11.351 --> 01:12:13.303
How is it that tomorrow's
match has already started?

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:15.028
-Yes, man.
-What would have happen?

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.128
-How dare you hit my boss?
-Hey! No. No...

01:12:18.799 --> 01:12:20.747
He is my friend. Don't hit him.

01:12:21.058 --> 01:12:23.138
Brother... Brother...
Take it, brother... Hit me...

01:12:23.808 --> 01:12:25.056
-What? Should I hit!
-Hit me, brother.

01:12:26.017 --> 01:12:27.899
Hit me. How ever much you want!

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.670
Hit me harder.

01:12:32.006 --> 01:12:32.479
Hit me.

01:12:34.191 --> 01:12:34.593
Hit me.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:38.820
Hey, you are drunk,

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.380
that is why you are
getting away with these beatings.

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:42.997
If not, it would be
another matter altogether.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.841
Devadas from Parvati Nagar.

01:12:54.308 --> 01:12:55.521
Hey brother!

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:58.083
Hey, my vice president.

01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:00.871
Hello...

01:13:02.773 --> 01:13:04.592
Will meet you soon.

01:13:06.192 --> 01:13:07.298
Soon.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:14.642
Oh god! Hey, come... hop on!

01:13:14.842 --> 01:13:15.999
When did I asked to come?

01:13:16.199 --> 01:13:18.778
Buddy, this GPS isn't working.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:21.152
I asked for one location and
it's showing me four locations.

01:13:21.392 --> 01:13:23.218
It's not GPS, it's your G. Move!

01:13:24.225 --> 01:13:25.586
Insurance has expired.

01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:27.677
Hey, stop.

01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:30.470
-Hey, stop.. stop.
-What buddy?

01:13:30.965 --> 01:13:32.148
-Come on now, blow into this.
-Hey!

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:33.020
-Look
-Sir...

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:36.878
That person does not drink. Let him go.

01:13:37.426 --> 01:13:38.984
-Okay, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

01:13:39.321 --> 01:13:40.621
Ok, ok.

01:13:41.972 --> 01:13:42.512
[sighs]

01:13:44.238 --> 01:13:46.110
[machine beeps]

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.605
-Sir!
-Yes?

01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:49.825
Just his breath is
hitting the reading 270.

01:13:50.606 --> 01:13:51.996
If he blows into it, the readings
might go through the roof.

01:13:58.291 --> 01:13:59.538
-270?
-Yeah, check it sir.

01:14:01.975 --> 01:14:05.366
-Mr. Devadas, do you habit of drinking?
-No, sir.

01:14:06.523 --> 01:14:12.523
Asking him about this is as useless
as asking Virat Kohli if he can bat?

01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:17.210
Jan. 26th, Aug. 15th, Oct. 2nd,

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:20.370
none of these public
holidays matter to him.

01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:25.552
He drinks 24/7, all the 365 days.

01:14:25.752 --> 01:14:27.870
He was born to drink.

01:14:37.551 --> 01:14:40.014
Why is this room filled with bottles?

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:47.625
The doctor said it had calcium,
magnesium, phosphorous and fiber.

01:15:03.026 --> 01:15:05.556
Why didn't you tell me that you drink?

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:07.037
Suvasana, you got it
wrong. Let me explain.

01:15:12.302 --> 01:15:16.551
The relationship between any
two people are based on trust.

01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:19.358
When that trust is broken,

01:15:20.436 --> 01:15:22.032
that relationship breaks too.

01:15:23.805 --> 01:15:25.875
It's... It's over now.

01:15:26.468 --> 01:15:26.886
Over?

01:15:27.894 --> 01:15:28.393
Break up!

01:15:29.017 --> 01:15:29.998
Suvasana... let me... Break up?

01:15:30.198 --> 01:15:33.311
Break up!

01:15:47.449 --> 01:15:48.817
[birds chirping]

01:15:51.423 --> 01:15:54.416
[cuckoo coos]

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:01.721
Hey! Why did you come into the bedroom?

01:16:01.921 --> 01:16:03.313
We didn't come into the bedroom.

01:16:03.472 --> 01:16:04.769
You came into the lawn.

01:16:05.099 --> 01:16:06.085
La... Lawn?

01:16:06.751 --> 01:16:07.749
[groans]

01:16:09.057 --> 01:16:10.182
What happened to me?

01:16:10.307 --> 01:16:14.057
You brought some guy last night and called
him your lovely friend and a lovely guest.

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:16.015
He bashed you badly.

01:16:17.349 --> 01:16:18.153
He hit me?

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:20.224
He played PUBG with your body.

01:16:20.557 --> 01:16:21.432
Who is he?

01:16:21.557 --> 01:16:26.307
Just like they do in the TV shows,
you keep bringing a guest each night.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:27.554
How will we know?

01:16:27.682 --> 01:16:29.890
Bring me that CCTV footage fast.

01:16:29.932 --> 01:16:31.037
What should we bring?

01:16:31.431 --> 01:16:33.765
Weren't you the one who told us to
switch off those cameras at night fall...

01:16:34.066 --> 01:16:40.000
so that your shenanigans wouldn't
give you an entry into police records?

01:16:40.932 --> 01:16:41.744
Damn!

01:16:42.099 --> 01:16:45.599
He drinks my liquor and hits me?

01:16:46.724 --> 01:16:47.724
Who is he?

01:16:49.377 --> 01:16:50.682
Where can I find him?

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.307
I will not leave him!

01:16:53.849 --> 01:16:56.363
You aren't even sober from last night's
drinking and here you're, with that 90 ml!

01:16:56.563 --> 01:16:57.220
Sairam.

01:16:57.599 --> 01:16:58.849
Sairam... Sairam.

01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:01.807
What is your prescribed dosage? Only 90ml.

01:17:02.057 --> 01:17:05.307
If the breath analyser hit 270 just with
a blow, how much would you have had?

01:17:05.391 --> 01:17:07.238
You are drinking to stay healthy.

01:17:07.496 --> 01:17:09.134
Not to spoil your health.

01:17:09.349 --> 01:17:10.152
Let it go, dad.

01:17:10.352 --> 01:17:11.354
This is the first and the last time.

01:17:11.554 --> 01:17:13.014
Of course, we will let it go.

01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:15.265
But what about that girl who let you go?

01:17:18.932 --> 01:17:22.265
Son, even her father
came to know that you drink.

01:17:22.849 --> 01:17:25.557
We don't have any faith at that he
would accept you as his son-in-law.

01:17:26.099 --> 01:17:27.474
Let her go.

01:17:27.682 --> 01:17:29.075
Mom, please stop nagging.

01:17:29.275 --> 01:17:33.897
Buddy, she blocked your mobile
number, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

01:17:34.097 --> 01:17:35.195
She blocked you completely.

01:17:35.395 --> 01:17:36.427
-Just listen to your mom.
-Eh...

01:17:39.182 --> 01:17:40.291
Not like that, son...

01:17:40.932 --> 01:17:45.182
Son, I worry that you will truly become
an alcoholic if you don't let her go.

01:17:45.765 --> 01:17:46.523
Please.

01:17:46.723 --> 01:17:48.265
Dad and Mom...

01:17:49.224 --> 01:17:52.015
I told you this before,
and I am telling you again now.

01:17:52.807 --> 01:17:55.890
The girl who's going to marry me is not
just going to be your daughter-in-law,

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.557
She should be like you daughter.

01:17:58.765 --> 01:18:00.265
And that girl is Suvasana.

01:18:08.557 --> 01:18:11.474
-Suvasana.
-Tell me father.

01:18:13.015 --> 01:18:16.057
There is an orthopaedic
surgeon called Dr. Ritesh.

01:18:16.515 --> 01:18:17.515
He lives in US.

01:18:18.265 --> 01:18:22.682
Apparently, the social cause posts that
you've put up on Facebook caught his eye.

01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:26.305
His family is asking
for marriage alliance.

01:18:26.996 --> 01:18:28.447
What do you say?

01:18:31.932 --> 01:18:33.182
As you wish, father.

01:18:35.015 --> 01:18:36.069
Okay.

01:18:36.724 --> 01:18:37.953
Okay. Okay.

01:18:38.807 --> 01:18:40.585
Okay. Okay.

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:45.254
[phone rings]

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.023
Hello.

01:18:47.231 --> 01:18:50.349
Madam, Sun Blues Hospital
people have given your number.

01:18:50.449 --> 01:18:51.917
My leg pain is acting up.

01:18:52.117 --> 01:18:52.729
Okay.

01:18:53.182 --> 01:18:54.709
Send me your location on WhatsApp.

01:18:54.909 --> 01:18:55.602
Alright, madam.

01:19:08.015 --> 01:19:09.390
Sir, are you the one who called?

01:19:09.515 --> 01:19:10.265
Yes, I am that one.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.015
Which leg?

01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:14.113
-Right leg.
-Hey, it's left leg.

01:19:14.472 --> 01:19:15.351
You...

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.349
What can I get you? Coffee or tea?

01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:19.882
-I don't want anything, sir.
-Please don't say that.

01:19:20.082 --> 01:19:20.788
You must have something.

01:19:21.015 --> 01:19:22.828
Boy! Get some coffee.

01:19:23.246 --> 01:19:23.970
Please sit down.

01:19:29.857 --> 01:19:32.012
Excuse me, have some coffee, please.

01:19:35.765 --> 01:19:37.068
-No, thanks.
-Ok, no problem.

01:19:37.349 --> 01:19:42.057
Uncle, why are you no longer posting
videos of your cover songs on YouTube?

01:19:42.849 --> 01:19:44.237
Have you been watching my cover songs?

01:19:44.552 --> 01:19:47.224
Yes. Everyone in our
family is a fan of yours.

01:19:48.265 --> 01:19:49.595
In that movie, 'Rangasthalam'...

01:19:49.715 --> 01:19:52.152
-that song "Rangamma, Mangamma..."
-"...What a boy he is"

01:19:52.765 --> 01:19:57.636
The way you and your wife danced
to that song is exceptionally good.

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.913
Did you subscribe to our channel?

01:20:00.658 --> 01:20:02.741
Yeah. I even press the bell icon.

01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:04.419
She even pressed the bell button it seems.

01:20:04.619 --> 01:20:06.721
Choke him with those very
hands! That will solve everything.

01:20:06.821 --> 01:20:09.682
Uncle, I want to see a live
performance of your dance.

01:20:09.882 --> 01:20:10.783
-Huh?
-Yeah

01:20:10.983 --> 01:20:12.187
Deny a fan? Never.

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:14.496
-Come on, play the song.
-Okay.

01:20:16.595 --> 01:20:20.140
"Like the rainbow in clouds
and the rain drop in the mud"

01:20:20.576 --> 01:20:23.474
"You hid like a thorn of love in my heart"

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.886
"My naughty wish is burning as
my beautiful hope is unfulfilled"

01:20:28.322 --> 01:20:31.058
"Is it to raise the madness
of love in me or to kill me?"

01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:35.557
"You're the girlfriend I wished
for, the damsel that left me."

01:20:35.909 --> 01:20:39.515
"You're a merciless demon
and the craze in my heart"

01:20:39.859 --> 01:20:43.244
"You're a fish-eyed
beauty and a strange sage"

01:20:43.557 --> 01:20:48.256
"You're my moonlight in the
dark, come to me beloved girl"

01:20:48.682 --> 01:20:51.432
"How do I live without
you? Come to me girl."

01:20:59.182 --> 01:21:01.131
You danced really well, uncle.

01:21:01.432 --> 01:21:02.039
Thanks.

01:21:02.294 --> 01:21:03.314
-You told me that you had leg pain.
-Huh!

01:21:04.579 --> 01:21:08.224
Well... that... It's gone.

01:21:10.557 --> 01:21:12.306
Don't play these cheap tricks with me.

01:21:12.557 --> 01:21:13.172
Good bye.

01:21:13.474 --> 01:21:17.307
Suvasana, please listen to me.

01:21:17.515 --> 01:21:19.570
Young man, my payment.

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:21.355
If you ask for your payment,
I am going to hurt you.

01:21:21.803 --> 01:21:24.265
You danced as soon as that girl requested!
Go and ask her to pay you.

01:21:31.281 --> 01:21:32.307
Hey!

01:21:33.082 --> 01:21:34.608
Whoa! Whoa!

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.098
Hey, move aside.

01:21:37.182 --> 01:21:39.182
-What's your problem?
-You are my problem.

01:21:41.807 --> 01:21:45.265
Suvasana,
I only hid the truth that I drink alcohol.

01:21:45.557 --> 01:21:47.127
I never lied that I don't drink alcohol.

01:21:47.327 --> 01:21:48.432
What's the difference?

01:21:49.224 --> 01:21:51.932
Truth is when you hide things
so that people don't get hurt

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.015
A lie is told when you
want to cheat people.

01:21:55.349 --> 01:21:58.432
Suvasana, every day and every moment
that I was with you, I had alcohol in me.

01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:02.890
But, did you ever get into any sort
of problem when I consumed alcohol?

01:22:03.557 --> 01:22:05.807
Did I ever cross my limits
and misbehave with you?

01:22:06.515 --> 01:22:08.432
Just point one mistake out from my end.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.706
This drinking habit of mine is indeed bad.
But my character isn't.

01:22:12.906 --> 01:22:14.015
Your character is indeed bad.

01:22:15.849 --> 01:22:17.009
You know my personality.

01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:18.474
You know the values of my family.

01:22:18.849 --> 01:22:20.432
You know what kind of house ours is.

01:22:21.057 --> 01:22:24.515
Despite knowing everything,
you had alcohol when you were with me

01:22:24.849 --> 01:22:26.390
What kind of a character you are?

01:22:27.459 --> 01:22:28.190
Cheater.

01:22:28.474 --> 01:22:29.387
You are a cheater.

01:22:29.659 --> 01:22:30.890
So, won't you even try to
get to know my problem?

01:22:30.974 --> 01:22:31.979
Won't you listen to my side of the story?

01:22:32.182 --> 01:22:33.152
No, I won't!

01:22:34.175 --> 01:22:35.260
What would you say?

01:22:35.724 --> 01:22:38.390
Drunkards will find hundreds
of reasons to justify themselves.

01:22:38.724 --> 01:22:40.849
Do I have to listen to
your stupid justifications?

01:22:41.765 --> 01:22:45.807
Even the biggest frauds of the world are
sincere with the women they love.

01:22:46.224 --> 01:22:47.241
You don't have that quality.

01:22:47.557 --> 01:22:48.365
Good bye!

01:23:03.265 --> 01:23:06.057
"They don't listen to you.
They just don't"

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:10.099
"Women simply don't listen."

01:23:12.182 --> 01:23:15.557
"Oh goodness... Oh goodness."

01:23:21.349 --> 01:23:24.557
"Oh my! Oh dear!"

01:23:25.724 --> 01:23:28.156
"They don't listen to you.
They just don't"

01:23:28.356 --> 01:23:32.474
"Women simply don't listen.
No matter how much you tell them"

01:23:36.835 --> 01:23:39.442
"They don't listen to you.
They just don't"

01:23:39.668 --> 01:23:43.432
"Women simply don't listen.
No matter how much you tell them"

01:23:44.057 --> 01:23:48.349
"They make you cry and they nag"

01:23:50.835 --> 01:23:55.170
"They make the guys crazy"

01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:59.154
"They say that the ears
are made for earrings"

01:23:59.354 --> 01:24:03.599
"They say that the ears
are made for earrings"

01:24:03.793 --> 01:24:07.530
"But, when you tell them golden words,"

01:24:08.837 --> 01:24:10.483
"They simply say Bye-Bye."

01:24:10.683 --> 01:24:12.893
"They bid us adieu."

01:24:13.472 --> 01:24:15.526
"They don't listen to you.
They just don't"

01:24:15.765 --> 01:24:19.765
"Women simply don't listen.
No matter how much you tell them"

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.334
"They don't listen to you.
They just don't"

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.640
"Women simply don't listen.
No matter how much you tell them"

01:24:29.724 --> 01:24:32.807
Buddy, this is my story.

01:24:33.307 --> 01:24:35.851
Brother, all the women in
the world are just the same.

01:24:36.051 --> 01:24:37.432
This is every guy's story.

01:24:56.497 --> 01:25:00.265
"You are the ones who
instigate guys to err"

01:25:00.599 --> 01:25:04.849
"And you are the one who
ensure that we keep on making"

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:07.765
"those mistakes."

01:25:09.765 --> 01:25:12.349
"You make a big deal of small things,"

01:25:14.474 --> 01:25:18.474
"and distance yourselves from
us you cut ties and leave us"

01:25:18.724 --> 01:25:22.724
"and distance yourselves from
us you cut ties and leave us"

01:25:23.057 --> 01:25:26.599
"We beg and plead,"

01:25:28.057 --> 01:25:31.807
"and you play hard to get."

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.819
"They don't listen to you.
They just don't"

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:39.140
"Women simply don't listen.
No matter how much you tell them"

01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:43.765
Buddy, they say that a woman's
heart is like a mirror.

01:25:44.432 --> 01:25:45.518
Yes, it is a mirror.

01:25:45.718 --> 01:25:47.224
But it is blackened on one side.

01:25:47.307 --> 01:25:49.890
So,
they can see no one other than themselves.

01:25:50.265 --> 01:25:52.307
Well said, buddy.

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:06.307
"They keep posting pictures
on TikTok and Instagram"

01:26:06.474 --> 01:26:10.515
"They put on an act
for likes and comments"

01:26:10.974 --> 01:26:13.765
"For some stranger,"

01:26:15.557 --> 01:26:17.954
"they laugh and giggle."

01:26:20.298 --> 01:26:23.838
"And display their beauty
on Facebook and share it."

01:26:24.682 --> 01:26:28.468
"And display their beauty
on Facebook and share it."

01:26:28.724 --> 01:26:32.015
"And for the guys who wants to
share their life with them,"

01:26:33.687 --> 01:26:35.245
"They don't have any time to spare."

01:26:35.445 --> 01:26:37.515
"No time to spare at all."

01:26:38.432 --> 01:26:44.432
"Please listen. Please listen.
Please listen to the guys at least once."

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:51.099
"Please listen. Please listen.
Please listen to the guys at least once."

01:26:54.682 --> 01:26:58.640
"At least one day... please listen to us."

01:27:02.686 --> 01:27:05.527
[church bell rings]

01:27:10.265 --> 01:27:11.318
My Lord...

01:27:11.807 --> 01:27:15.035
I, Jojappa John Wick,
your innocent worshipper

01:27:15.737 --> 01:27:19.419
was beaten up black and
blue by some stranger.

01:27:20.099 --> 01:27:24.890
God, please help me in finding out
the address of the guy who beat me up.

01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:26.557
Praise the lord.

01:27:27.015 --> 01:27:28.015
Jesus.

01:27:28.265 --> 01:27:29.349
Hallelujah!

01:27:32.724 --> 01:27:33.840
My dear Children...

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.557
To make sure all your
problems are resolved,

01:27:37.682 --> 01:27:41.057
god has come to you in my form.

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:44.057
Come and tell me your problems.

01:27:44.307 --> 01:27:45.057
Father...

01:27:46.099 --> 01:27:46.849
Father...

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.390
Father...

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:50.622
Father...

01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:55.314
Tell me, son.
Your voice tells me something is wrong.

01:27:55.399 --> 01:27:58.015
I was beaten up by
someone yesterday, father.

01:27:58.765 --> 01:28:02.352
He drank my wine, beat me up and left.

01:28:02.552 --> 01:28:04.707
Oh Jehovah! Why did he hit you?

01:28:04.907 --> 01:28:09.432
If I know who hit me,
I would know why he hit me.

01:28:10.974 --> 01:28:13.367
So, if you find out who hit you,

01:28:13.825 --> 01:28:17.316
would you retaliate and become a sinner?

01:28:17.898 --> 01:28:18.543
No, Father.

01:28:19.564 --> 01:28:22.515
According to the book of
Mathew, Chapter 5 and Verse 21...

01:28:22.890 --> 01:28:24.682
I am an advocate of non-violence.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:28.151
I won't hit him. But I will
just find out why he hit me.

01:28:28.351 --> 01:28:28.915
Please, father.

01:28:29.235 --> 01:28:32.212
I want to know who he
is and why he hit me.

01:28:32.412 --> 01:28:35.599
Meditation is the best
solution for many problems.

01:28:36.182 --> 01:28:39.224
One of the best ways to
solve problems is meditation.

01:28:39.515 --> 01:28:43.265
When you meditate, there's a strong chance
that you could figure out who hit you.

01:28:43.577 --> 01:28:45.403
Father... Father!

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.644
Oh no!

01:28:47.515 --> 01:28:49.265
I got the solution...

01:28:49.765 --> 01:28:50.765
Thank you...

01:28:51.557 --> 01:28:53.750
-The lord is your shepherd.
-Thank you Father!

01:28:54.349 --> 01:28:55.710
God bless you, my child.

01:28:56.099 --> 01:28:56.945
I love you.

01:28:57.145 --> 01:28:59.116
[tires screeching]

01:28:59.816 --> 01:29:01.307
-I told him I'd kick him... look...
-Greetings brother.

01:29:01.507 --> 01:29:02.597
-John Brother...
-Greetings brother.

01:29:02.797 --> 01:29:04.724
-Greetings Brother...
-Greetings John Wick bro...

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.599
What happened, brother?

01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:11.955
-Brother...
-Why is your face all swollen up?

01:29:12.349 --> 01:29:15.599
Oh no! Brother's face is all swollen up.

01:29:15.936 --> 01:29:17.640
-What happened?
-Tell me, bro!

01:29:18.265 --> 01:29:20.182
I was beaten up by someone yesterday.

01:29:20.557 --> 01:29:22.349
The mosquito doesn't
have the guts to bit you.

01:29:22.974 --> 01:29:24.682
How dare he beat you, brother?

01:29:25.015 --> 01:29:26.141
Tell me, bro...

01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:28.255
I am going to chop his
head off and display it.

01:29:28.557 --> 01:29:29.807
If only I knew, Bojja.

01:29:30.849 --> 01:29:32.765
If only I knew who he was...

01:29:34.724 --> 01:29:36.307
How could you not know who hit you?

01:29:36.432 --> 01:29:41.640
You know that I bring a
guest home every day, right?

01:29:42.932 --> 01:29:46.682
He came as a guest and
thrashed me up and left.

01:29:48.932 --> 01:29:53.224
Imagine the pain one would feel if
they didn't know who their father was.

01:29:53.307 --> 01:29:58.379
The pain of not knowing who hit you...

01:29:58.898 --> 01:30:00.464
...is quite similar to that.

01:30:01.099 --> 01:30:01.758
That's true.

01:30:01.958 --> 01:30:05.432
That is why, I went to the church and
met with the father for a solution.

01:30:05.724 --> 01:30:07.265
He told me to meditate.

01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:08.383
So, mediate brother.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.682
Let's do it!

01:30:19.765 --> 01:30:21.812
He is taking the
mediation quite seriously.

01:30:22.293 --> 01:30:23.774
Do you think he will
figure out who that is?

01:30:23.974 --> 01:30:27.724
Figuring out things with meditation is
not as easy as sucking on a chocolate.

01:30:28.484 --> 01:30:29.328
-Huh?
-Hmm...

01:30:46.906 --> 01:30:47.974
Hey, Bojja!

01:30:49.057 --> 01:30:50.619
So, have you figured who it is, brother?

01:30:50.849 --> 01:30:53.890
Bojja, I saw Balayya
Babu, when I meditated.

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.138
Balayya Babu?

01:30:55.338 --> 01:30:58.390
So, the person who hit me is Balayya Babu?

01:30:58.474 --> 01:31:01.765
Oh brother, why would Balayya
babu hit useless people like you?

01:31:01.807 --> 01:31:03.265
He only hits his fans.

01:31:03.474 --> 01:31:04.849
He hits with them with love.

01:31:04.932 --> 01:31:06.224
He hits them with his charm.

01:31:06.349 --> 01:31:09.599
To be hit by Balayya babu,
you need to have a lot of luck.

01:31:09.724 --> 01:31:12.697
I don't think he would even ring the
doorbell of a useless person such as you.

01:31:12.932 --> 01:31:14.039
How would he hit you?

01:31:14.239 --> 01:31:15.323
Amudam...

01:31:15.974 --> 01:31:18.474
You are crossing your limits.

01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:23.727
So,
why did I see him in my meditative state?

01:31:23.932 --> 01:31:25.599
Brother, you are not doing a
good job with your meditation.

01:31:25.974 --> 01:31:29.640
While meditating, you need to train
all your focus at your centre.

01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:31.890
I saw Ramdev Baba saying it on TV.

01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:33.098
Oh!

01:31:33.298 --> 01:31:34.390
Let's try that.

01:31:47.099 --> 01:31:49.849
Certain things are to be
taken at their face value, dude!

01:31:51.182 --> 01:31:53.724
Brother, this time around,
did you see Chiranjeevi? (actor)

01:31:54.557 --> 01:31:57.432
-Would you like a small peg?
-No, make it large.

01:31:58.974 --> 01:32:02.057
In the village,
people are binge drinking toddy.

01:32:02.265 --> 01:32:04.015
Big bro, is there no way these
people will mend their ways?

01:32:04.182 --> 01:32:06.398
The only way is to make a rule
that people who drink will be killed.

01:32:07.135 --> 01:32:08.016
Super!

01:32:08.224 --> 01:32:08.958
Very nice, dear.

01:32:09.158 --> 01:32:13.140
He keeps drinking while saying that
people who drink ought to be killed.

01:32:13.765 --> 01:32:16.524
And with your job of imposing
penalties on people who drink,

01:32:16.724 --> 01:32:17.916
are enjoying watching it.

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:19.224
Very nice!

01:32:19.557 --> 01:32:20.515
You had alcohol, right?

01:32:22.807 --> 01:32:26.099
How did he find out? I thought we
managed the evidence pretty well.

01:32:26.515 --> 01:32:29.200
Well, it's because you ate with your
right hand and washed your left hand.

01:32:30.864 --> 01:32:32.039
Did you see that?

01:32:32.349 --> 01:32:35.682
Even after he consumed alcohol, he
never was a nuisance to people around him.

01:32:36.015 --> 01:32:39.515
Although he has a disgusting
habit, his character isn't disgusting.

01:32:41.524 --> 01:32:42.962
That is Megastar!

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:54.640
'Maybe I have a bad habit But I
don't have a bad personality.'

01:33:09.121 --> 01:33:09.858
Give me a Blenders Pride.

01:33:10.515 --> 01:33:11.724
He works in a wine shop?

01:33:17.057 --> 01:33:19.515
Let's make video call not a normal call.

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.150
Hey... Suvasana!
[phone rings]

01:33:25.807 --> 01:33:26.807
Hello Miss Suvasana.

01:33:26.932 --> 01:33:28.515
Why are there bottles behind you?

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:32.765
Bottles? They are not bottles.
That is a poster containing bottles.

01:33:33.599 --> 01:33:34.284
'Lying again.'

01:33:34.687 --> 01:33:35.890
'He is lying again and again.'

01:33:39.224 --> 01:33:39.659
Where are you?

01:33:44.432 --> 01:33:45.680
At the wine shop.

01:33:45.952 --> 01:33:48.699
Are you in the wine shop or Vines app?

01:33:48.899 --> 01:33:50.730
Not App... I am at the shop.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.320
Just come out once.

01:33:53.557 --> 01:33:54.694
Hey, surprise!

01:33:55.749 --> 01:33:56.151
Hi.

01:33:56.624 --> 01:33:57.206
Get on the bike.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:58.843
Where are we going?

01:33:59.515 --> 01:34:01.413
Won't you get on unless I tell you to?

01:34:01.724 --> 01:34:04.977
Of course, yes. I will even
climb an electric pole for you.

01:34:05.165 --> 01:34:07.532
It would be better if you
stopped with this silliness.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.531
Anyways, where are we going?

01:34:13.994 --> 01:34:15.700
I am taking you so that I can rape you.

01:34:16.019 --> 01:34:16.800
Why? Not interested?

01:34:17.169 --> 01:34:18.392
You, naughty girl!

01:34:20.295 --> 01:34:21.860
Really? Do you want to?

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:22.846
Shut up and sit.

01:34:26.057 --> 01:34:28.165
Brother... that wine shop fellow.

01:34:32.841 --> 01:34:34.866
Turn the vehicle around.
[tires screeching]

01:34:38.432 --> 01:34:39.974
Drive... drive... drive...

01:34:42.849 --> 01:34:44.687
Ram into him! Come on!

01:34:45.099 --> 01:34:48.043
Slow! Slow!

01:34:48.272 --> 01:34:49.960
[tires screeching]
-Hey!

01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:57.689
You idiot! Rascal!

01:35:03.126 --> 01:35:04.085
He escaped.

01:35:05.057 --> 01:35:05.673
I won't leave him!

01:35:06.838 --> 01:35:08.761

-Nadiridinna
-Come!

01:35:15.414 --> 01:35:16.263
I am coming.

01:35:23.662 --> 01:35:24.716
-Hi Suvasana!
-Hi, sir.

01:35:25.454 --> 01:35:28.331
-Is he the one you were talking about?
-Yes, sir.

01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:30.312
-You go to your class.
-Ok.

01:35:30.412 --> 01:35:31.506
-You go to your house.
-Okay sir,

01:35:32.996 --> 01:35:33.476
Deva...

01:35:34.241 --> 01:35:38.193
Despite all that has happened, I got you
here with the intention to change you...

01:35:38.995 --> 01:35:41.152
Please try and understand my love for you.

01:35:42.212 --> 01:35:48.147
Pleasing a girl you love doesn't
mean you do the things she loves...

01:35:49.062 --> 01:35:51.079
but rather stop doing
the things she hates.

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:56.127
For the sake of me, for
our love, for relationship,

01:35:56.654 --> 01:35:59.736
I am of the belief that
you will give up this habit.

01:35:59.936 --> 01:36:02.926
Suvasana, please listen to me
once. After that, you can talk.

01:36:03.097 --> 01:36:06.043
Deva... we are just 25.

01:36:07.287 --> 01:36:11.437
At this age, you can make the impossible
possible, if we put our minds to it.

01:36:12.479 --> 01:36:13.715
I will be back in two days, okay?

01:36:13.915 --> 01:36:14.501
-No Suva...
-Hello!

01:36:14.886 --> 01:36:16.920
I spoke to you in Telugu
and told you to go inside.

01:36:17.549 --> 01:36:18.059
Get inside...

01:36:18.526 --> 01:36:19.397
-Go!
-Bye!

01:36:22.915 --> 01:36:25.574
Sir, what's your treatment process like?
[chuckles]

01:36:26.245 --> 01:36:29.943
All day long there will be lectures and
in the nights, we use harsher methods.

01:36:30.395 --> 01:36:31.558
Harsher methods?
Does that mean you will hit him?

01:36:31.967 --> 01:36:34.569
Of course, yes. Beat him to pulp.

01:36:38.832 --> 01:36:41.866
No, sir. Please don't do that.
Mr. Devadas is very soft.

01:36:42.162 --> 01:36:44.899
Doesn't matter if he is either
soft or hard It is the same treatment.

01:36:45.247 --> 01:36:46.095
Okay? Don't worry.

01:36:46.349 --> 01:36:48.070
Go. Go now...

01:36:48.308 --> 01:36:49.105
Sir...

01:36:51.345 --> 01:36:51.956
God!

01:36:52.579 --> 01:36:56.820
"The virtues of drinking
alcohol, The taste of liquor"

01:36:57.204 --> 01:37:02.971
"If one figures this
out, liquor is a blessing."

01:37:03.353 --> 01:37:06.772
"It is the habit best
friends inculcate in you".

01:37:07.079 --> 01:37:11.381
"If you forget it,
it is as good as forgetting your buddies"

01:37:12.245 --> 01:37:14.633
"Don't quit drinking!"

01:37:15.016 --> 01:37:17.244
[everyone cheering]

01:37:17.727 --> 01:37:19.623
Hey silence... I said silence!

01:37:20.704 --> 01:37:24.630
If you drown music and literature
in liquor, I will beat you to pulp.

01:37:25.514 --> 01:37:26.894
Doctor. Nadaradinna here.

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:29.748
-What's your name?
-Devadas.

01:37:29.956 --> 01:37:31.553
Oh! You have been living up to your name.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.969
-How much do you down daily?
-I drink 90 ml of liquor 3 times a day.

01:37:34.329 --> 01:37:36.723
-Why not 180ml?
-Doctor advised me to consume only 90 ml.

01:37:36.983 --> 01:37:38.579
Huh! A doctor told you
to? Who's that fellow?

01:37:38.878 --> 01:37:39.380
[clears throat]

01:37:39.772 --> 01:37:42.132
Basically, I am an authorized drinker.

01:37:42.754 --> 01:37:44.058
An authorized drinker?

01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:47.202
An Authorized Drinker Certificate!

01:37:47.402 --> 01:37:50.230
I saw cast and income certificates.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.054
I saw a birth certificate
and even a death certificate.

01:37:53.254 --> 01:37:55.532
Where can I get this
Authorized Drinker certificate, brother?

01:37:55.732 --> 01:37:56.732
-Brother! Tell me.
-Brother!

01:37:56.832 --> 01:37:59.097
Even if costs over a lakh,
I don't mind, brother. I want it.

01:37:59.462 --> 01:38:01.498
Big bro,
does this permit work only locally?

01:38:01.698 --> 01:38:02.867
Or does it have national coverage?

01:38:02.967 --> 01:38:05.276
Give them the address and phone
number they will get one too.

01:38:05.516 --> 01:38:07.590
Sit down you...

01:38:08.806 --> 01:38:10.337
-I will beat you to pulp.
-Hi sir!

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:13.493
-Hey, Ramesh! How are you?
-I am doing good, sir.

01:38:13.962 --> 01:38:16.624
My dear alcohol folks, he is Mr. Ramesh.

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:21.400
He did a crash course here
and within a week quit alcohol,

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:22.231
He is an outstanding student.

01:38:22.462 --> 01:38:23.151
Give him a big hand!

01:38:23.406 --> 01:38:25.464
Thank you very much
[applause]

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:27.562
-What are you doing?
-I am busy with work.

01:38:27.823 --> 01:38:29.378
Stupid fellows.
Look, he is busy with work.

01:38:29.879 --> 01:38:30.694
What is it that you do?

01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:35.926
I am busy drinking day and night.

01:38:36.126 --> 01:38:37.720
[shouting]
[applauding]

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:38.535
Hey!

01:38:39.325 --> 01:38:41.933
-Are you joking?
-Am I a joker?

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:44.793
I am a drinker! Drinker!

01:38:46.004 --> 01:38:48.742
You told me that if you are
unsuccessful in making us quit alcohol,

01:38:48.963 --> 01:38:52.193
you would return our money
back. Give me back my 50,000.

01:38:52.587 --> 01:38:55.084
I don't have money to
drink. My pockets are empty.

01:38:55.169 --> 01:38:57.175
Ramesh,
for the kind of treatment I gave you,

01:38:57.375 --> 01:38:59.638
Forget drinking alcohol.
You can't even stand it's smell.

01:38:59.838 --> 01:39:01.080
Are you lying just to get money?

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.933
Hey! I won't lie and
cheat for money like you.

01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:05.417
-Get me alcohol, I'll drink!
-Oh is it?

01:39:05.952 --> 01:39:08.111
-Get a bottle of liquor.
-Yes. Get it.

01:39:08.379 --> 01:39:09.375
-Here it is...
-Give it here...

01:39:09.931 --> 01:39:10.441
You can go.

01:39:11.514 --> 01:39:12.421
This stupid cap.

01:39:17.473 --> 01:39:18.943
[applause]

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.184
Stop it.

01:39:21.504 --> 01:39:23.468
-How could you drink it straight?
-Now just this...

01:39:23.668 --> 01:39:25.562
If you don't give me the
money, I will drink your blood...

01:39:26.639 --> 01:39:29.819
-Guards, take him outside. Take him.
-Hey!

01:39:30.254 --> 01:39:34.437
-I will drink your blood like juice...
-Take him away.

01:39:35.212 --> 01:39:37.437
My dear students, Let's start the class.

01:39:38.279 --> 01:39:39.209
Stop the class.

01:39:40.962 --> 01:39:43.479
You keep assuring stuff like last
batch, crash course, best student.

01:39:43.754 --> 01:39:45.687
But the reality is he came back and is
demanding that you pay back his money.

01:39:45.882 --> 01:39:48.104
We are not at all confident
that you will help us quit alcohol.

01:39:48.454 --> 01:39:49.955
-Yes we lost it!
-It's ok...

01:39:51.045 --> 01:39:53.187
Oh, you need trust?

01:39:53.837 --> 01:39:59.145
Guards, get them all to the dark
room. I will show them trust.

01:40:01.587 --> 01:40:02.203
Shut the doors.

01:40:02.406 --> 01:40:03.679
[bashing sound]

01:40:04.545 --> 01:40:09.187
Hey! Give us all the details
of your swindling activities.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:12.768
If you don't remove that board
that says 'New Life' outside...

01:40:13.305 --> 01:40:14.638
you will have no life at all.

01:40:16.337 --> 01:40:17.316
Tell Mr. Ritesh.

01:40:18.295 --> 01:40:20.479
Everything is clear from
our side for the match making

01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:24.937
Mrs. Sookshma, this is the
perfect match for Ms. Suvasana.

01:40:25.754 --> 01:40:28.812
If this alliance goes through,
I will be the happiest person.

01:40:29.462 --> 01:40:32.354
-Father...
-Please don't say anything.

01:40:32.837 --> 01:40:33.783
Father, the thing is...

01:40:36.212 --> 01:40:38.009
-I don't want to listen to anything.
-Please listen...

01:40:38.337 --> 01:40:42.137
Parents give their children freedom
not for falling in love and breaking up.

01:40:42.607 --> 01:40:44.854
It's so that you can make
something of themselves and make us proud.

01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:49.812
Did you not take Mr. Devadas
to the rehabilitation centre?

01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.229
Did you or didn't you?

01:40:54.295 --> 01:40:57.103
I am not just a father.
I am a police officer as well.

01:40:57.962 --> 01:41:00.553
You agree with your father
and you agree with your lover as well.

01:41:00.753 --> 01:41:01.370
Don't you have integrity?

01:41:02.045 --> 01:41:04.653
At a traffic signal, if both
sides display green signal,

01:41:04.853 --> 01:41:06.110
there will be a loss of
life due to accidents.

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.770
Fathers should feel that
daughters are their responsibility.

01:41:14.387 --> 01:41:15.254
Not a burden.

01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:19.103
But the fear that you might turn
into a burden for me has started in me.

01:41:21.124 --> 01:41:22.844
And so, I decided to
get rid of that burden.

01:41:23.795 --> 01:41:24.803
This alliance is finalised.

01:41:49.348 --> 01:41:50.316
What's this torture bro?

01:41:50.712 --> 01:41:53.937
For the past one week,
he's make us roam the outskirts.

01:41:54.504 --> 01:41:55.218
And this area,

01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:58.038
people use it to defecate in the mornings.

01:41:58.462 --> 01:42:01.395
And amidst all this stench,
how is he able to meditate?

01:42:01.595 --> 01:42:01.999
Yuck!

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:03.101
Hey... shut it!

01:42:04.045 --> 01:42:07.144
I am feeling thirsty. Get me
a water bottle from the car.

01:42:07.407 --> 01:42:08.972
Here, there seems to be
some water here. Take it.

01:42:18.837 --> 01:42:21.260
Brother, I put some water
here but I can't seem to find it.

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:22.375
Brother was thirsty so he drank it.

01:42:23.045 --> 01:42:24.400
With what should I clean myself now?

01:42:26.148 --> 01:42:27.221
You jackass!

01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:30.653
You got me the water that he
was gonna use to clean his rear?

01:42:31.162 --> 01:42:32.530
-Oh no! no!
-You dumbo!

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:35.655
[bashing]

01:42:39.129 --> 01:42:41.395
Devadas from Parvathi Nagar!

01:42:42.092 --> 01:42:43.333
-[shouts]
-Bojja!

01:42:44.945 --> 01:42:45.345
Bro?

01:42:45.545 --> 01:42:46.977
I remember him now. Start the vehicle!

01:42:55.837 --> 01:42:57.133
Excuse me, brother...

01:42:58.062 --> 01:43:00.407
-The rehabilitation centre here...
-That was past...

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.354
Ever since the alcoholic Devadas joined
the place, they've changed their set up.

01:43:03.704 --> 01:43:04.736
BEAUTY PARLOR TRAINING CENTER

01:43:19.533 --> 01:43:20.777
-Bojja...
-Bro?

01:43:22.565 --> 01:43:26.645
That Devadas lives in this Parvati Nagar.

01:43:28.387 --> 01:43:31.020
Devadas from Parvati Nagar!

01:43:34.087 --> 01:43:34.953
-Hey Avadham...
-What?

01:43:35.462 --> 01:43:37.605
He says it's Devadas from Parvati Nagar.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:43.866
Do you think it's the same
Devadas who hit us as well?

01:43:44.066 --> 01:43:46.938
Big bro,
there are many colonies in Hyderabad.

01:43:47.212 --> 01:43:51.371
There must be lots of people with the
same name. Why are you getting worried?

01:43:51.841 --> 01:43:52.656
Why would I get worried?

01:43:52.856 --> 01:43:53.607
[laughs]

01:43:54.179 --> 01:43:55.188
Where is Devadas's house?

01:43:55.388 --> 01:43:58.610
Devadas? You mean that tall
guy who looks like movie star?

01:43:58.826 --> 01:43:59.621
Perfect. Where does he stay?

01:43:59.995 --> 01:44:00.974
That is the house.

01:44:03.254 --> 01:44:05.046
I love you, my king.

01:44:05.597 --> 01:44:09.666
Bojja, go and sit in the car.

01:44:09.766 --> 01:44:13.045
-Why, brother? Drag him out.
-Bojja!

01:44:13.285 --> 01:44:15.605
-If you kill him in a fit of rage...
-Heard that?

01:44:15.805 --> 01:44:17.960
how would I be able to
find out why he hit me?

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.562
So, get in the car and enjoy
the music. Go... Go on.

01:44:21.762 --> 01:44:23.434
-Go, go. Go man! Come on move!
-Okay brother.

01:44:29.494 --> 01:44:33.987
Buddy, somehow I get the
feeling that it's the same person.

01:44:34.504 --> 01:44:39.068
Bro, if it's the same person, our
brother will be kicked out at once. Look.

01:44:39.454 --> 01:44:40.736
[screams]

01:44:41.037 --> 01:44:41.668
Oh god!

01:44:49.868 --> 01:44:50.614
It's the same guy!

01:44:55.087 --> 01:44:57.370
Hey! Why are you hitting me? Why?

01:44:58.087 --> 01:45:00.613
Tell me why and then hit me, bro.

01:45:00.822 --> 01:45:01.454
Why're you hitting me?

01:45:07.278 --> 01:45:08.026
Hey Bojja!

01:45:08.728 --> 01:45:09.291
Bojja!

01:45:09.566 --> 01:45:11.215
He is calling you. Anyway, I don't know.

01:45:11.415 --> 01:45:12.612
Bojja... save me. Bojja...

01:45:12.712 --> 01:45:13.996
John bro is a very nice guy.

01:45:14.196 --> 01:45:16.327
-He made us sit inside.
-Yes, brother.

01:45:19.962 --> 01:45:20.759
Move it!

01:45:45.462 --> 01:45:47.920
-Su... Suvasana...
-Don't speak.

01:45:49.589 --> 01:45:52.408
I believed you and your love, Deva.

01:45:53.254 --> 01:45:56.413
And you proved me that you don't love me.

01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:01.706
When you love a person,
it's not just about living for each other.

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:05.300
It's about sacrificing
things for your partner.

01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:09.112
You can't even do such a
tiny thing as quitting alcohol.

01:46:09.431 --> 01:46:11.688
I can understand how
much love you have for me.

01:46:12.212 --> 01:46:14.921
-That's not it, Suvasana... listen to me.
-How many more lies will you tell?

01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:19.462
The first day, when you
lied about your mother's back pain,

01:46:19.725 --> 01:46:21.441
If I had left you right then.

01:46:21.777 --> 01:46:25.074
I would not have had to face this day.

01:46:26.254 --> 01:46:30.720
It was my mistake to have
reasoned that lie off as love for me.

01:46:31.156 --> 01:46:32.892
That is when you took me for granted.

01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:38.268
You lied to me about working in the wine
shop. Everything you told me was a lie.

01:46:40.762 --> 01:46:44.675
Enough! It was my mistake
to have tried to change you.

01:46:45.654 --> 01:46:48.770
I am so in love with you that
I don't mind dying with you.

01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:53.729
But, you don't have even a single
thought of spending your life with me.

01:46:54.795 --> 01:46:55.804
I hate you.

01:46:57.459 --> 01:46:59.523
I hate you!

01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:37.347
Why do you look like a
punctured tire that has been patched up?

01:47:38.007 --> 01:47:42.925
The wounds of the second meeting with
the guy who bashed me in the first meet.

01:47:43.125 --> 01:47:44.002
He hit you again?

01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:45.418
Oh Jehovah!

01:47:45.618 --> 01:47:47.966
Did you ask him the why he hit you?

01:47:48.166 --> 01:47:51.850
I did ask him, father.
And because of that he beat me to pulp.

01:47:52.087 --> 01:47:52.761
Oh lord!

01:47:52.876 --> 01:47:56.560
As soon as sees me,
he gets angry and starts to thrash me up.

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.219
That must mean I must have
done something very horrendous.

01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.103
I want to know what it is. Please, father.

01:48:02.303 --> 01:48:02.667
[scoffs]

01:48:03.754 --> 01:48:04.559
Jojappah.

01:48:05.208 --> 01:48:10.575
In this entire world,
something as small as an ant bite

01:48:10.815 --> 01:48:13.240
and even the birth of a
human has a reason behind it.

01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:15.083
-Do one thing.
-What is it, father?

01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:19.096
-The image of the man who hit you...
-What image?

01:48:19.514 --> 01:48:23.525
Jesus... Image... I meant photograph.

01:48:25.254 --> 01:48:29.121
Photograph?! Got it, father. Got it.

01:48:29.321 --> 01:48:33.568
Put his photograph in
front of you. Concentrate

01:48:33.872 --> 01:48:36.785
and singularly focus on
that photo and meditate on it.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.005
It will come to you
suddenly why he hit you.

01:48:43.754 --> 01:48:45.925
Wow. Thank you, father!

01:48:48.461 --> 01:48:50.143
-Thank you, father.
-Jojappah!

01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:54.472
Thank you, father. I love you.

01:48:56.191 --> 01:48:57.972
-Bojja...-Tell me bro.

01:48:58.172 --> 01:49:00.107
I need the photographs of
that Devadas immediately.

01:49:00.928 --> 01:49:01.640
Fast!

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:07.990
[glass breaks]

01:49:12.295 --> 01:49:13.522
Come on, bro!

01:49:14.374 --> 01:49:17.772
Welcome to my palace.

01:49:18.122 --> 01:49:19.843
-Come with me.
-It's superb, sir!

01:49:20.043 --> 01:49:23.015
This is heaven of my home.

01:49:23.215 --> 01:49:24.735
-Sit down.
-Thank you sir.

01:49:26.587 --> 01:49:28.048
Tell me about you brother.

01:49:28.148 --> 01:49:30.242
My name is Devadasu
sir. I work in a wine shop.

01:49:30.554 --> 01:49:31.271
What?

01:49:31.471 --> 01:49:33.776
You look like an educated
white-collared employee.

01:49:34.403 --> 01:49:36.083
Why are you working in a wine shop?

01:49:36.379 --> 01:49:40.108
-What is your qualification?
-MBA in Finance with a gold medal.

01:49:40.308 --> 01:49:40.769
What!

01:49:40.969 --> 01:49:45.475
MBA in Finance with a gold
medal? I am impressed. I am impressed.

01:49:46.504 --> 01:49:47.646
And an authorized drinker too.

01:49:47.846 --> 01:49:50.412
Authorized drinker?
What does that mean?

01:49:50.698 --> 01:49:52.593
I have to have 90ml of
Alcohol three times a day, sir.

01:49:52.801 --> 01:49:53.632
If not...

01:49:54.063 --> 01:49:56.058
Even if I miss the dosage
even once, I will die.

01:49:56.336 --> 01:49:59.211
What a kick-ass disease!

01:50:00.962 --> 01:50:03.879
Isn't this the reason why
you can never get drunk?

01:50:04.079 --> 01:50:05.256
[laughs]

01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:11.670
Hey! I like this place.
I love drinking from here, brother.

01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:16.085
-Can I ask you something, sir?
-Yeah.

01:50:16.566 --> 01:50:20.588
You lead such a rich life.
What about your life partner?

01:50:21.309 --> 01:50:27.309
An astrologer told me that I would
get a wife who looks like the moon.

01:50:27.705 --> 01:50:28.146
Oh...

01:50:28.382 --> 01:50:33.462
I looked at the sky for that
moon. Instead, I found many stars.

01:50:33.662 --> 01:50:39.087
I touched all the stars that I could
see. But, I didn't find the moon yet.

01:50:39.379 --> 01:50:42.945
I am a bachelor but not a virgin.

01:50:43.245 --> 01:50:45.161
Whoohoo!

01:50:45.539 --> 01:50:47.331
[phone rings]

01:50:49.337 --> 01:50:50.231
Suvasana...

01:50:50.949 --> 01:50:52.008
-Hi...
-Hi!

01:50:52.208 --> 01:50:54.910
I'm planning to tell father about us.

01:50:55.210 --> 01:50:56.395
You come home in the morning.

01:50:56.595 --> 01:50:57.852
Okay, sure.

01:51:01.587 --> 01:51:05.848
Bro, wasn't that your moon who called you?

01:51:06.753 --> 01:51:10.424
Can I see the picture of your loved one?

01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:11.314
Please.

01:51:13.321 --> 01:51:14.069
Sure, sir.

01:51:17.399 --> 01:51:21.543
Oh! Truly...

01:51:23.317 --> 01:51:25.729
She is a beauty like the moon.

01:51:25.929 --> 01:51:26.475
Yes, sir

01:51:27.045 --> 01:51:28.560
So beautiful...

01:51:29.252 --> 01:51:31.981
Bro, we will enter into a new agreement.

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:39.086
You will have to leave your girlfriend.

01:51:40.196 --> 01:51:43.851
I will love her and marry her.

01:51:48.209 --> 01:51:50.088
[screams]

01:51:51.437 --> 01:51:53.417
-Bojja... Bojja.
-Bro!

01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:55.600
Do you remember why he hit you?

01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:00.697
When he showed me his girl's picture,
I asked him to leave his lover for me

01:52:00.897 --> 01:52:02.258
-That was the reason why he hit me.
-Oh!

01:52:02.458 --> 01:52:04.487
That is exactly why he hit me.

01:52:04.687 --> 01:52:06.872
Even I would hit someone for that wish.

01:52:07.328 --> 01:52:08.083
Hey, Amudam!

01:52:09.953 --> 01:52:11.637
You are crossing your limits.

01:52:12.170 --> 01:52:12.720
Sorry...

01:52:14.993 --> 01:52:19.861
Bojja, I want the profile
of Devadas's girlfriend.

01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:22.231
Bro, I'm a follower of
doctor's Facebook account.

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:23.348
-Yes, brother.
-One minute

01:52:28.764 --> 01:52:30.962
Wow! Super!

01:52:31.504 --> 01:52:33.601
She is so beautiful!

01:52:36.879 --> 01:52:39.124
I love her, Bojja!

01:52:40.899 --> 01:52:42.044
Oh his antics!

01:52:51.689 --> 01:52:53.035
-Hello Dr. Ritesh. Welcome.
-Hi uncle, how are you?

01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:55.203
What is this, uncle?

01:52:56.164 --> 01:52:57.964
Kshunakar Rao Nature's abode?

01:52:58.365 --> 01:52:59.791
[breaks in laughter]

01:53:00.324 --> 01:53:02.486
What's a 'Nature's abode'? How silly!

01:53:03.507 --> 01:53:05.334
He looks a bit abnormal!

01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:09.852
Anyways uncle... Kshunnakar Rao, Sukshma,

01:53:10.052 --> 01:53:11.756
Suvasana, Aveshita...

01:53:11.956 --> 01:53:12.830
What kind of names are these?

01:53:14.544 --> 01:53:16.341
How funny!
[laughs]

01:53:19.335 --> 01:53:20.906
Aveshita! Thank you.

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:24.601
Uncle, there seems to be a huge age
gap between both your daughters?

01:53:24.801 --> 01:53:25.598
-True.
[Ritesh chuckles]

01:53:25.798 --> 01:53:27.124
If you had that fire that you
named your daughter with,

01:53:27.232 --> 01:53:28.088
there wouldn't be huge age difference.

01:53:29.177 --> 01:53:30.466
Well, I was simply asking.

01:53:41.997 --> 01:53:42.667
Wow...

01:53:43.785 --> 01:53:45.842
Uncle, before going to further discussion,

01:53:46.228 --> 01:53:47.575
I just want to ask one thing.

01:53:49.113 --> 01:53:51.511
Suvasana, do you have any love affairs?

01:53:51.711 --> 01:53:53.234
[door bell ringing]

01:54:04.464 --> 01:54:05.912
Who is this guy? How got in suddenly!

01:54:07.964 --> 01:54:08.840
Uncle, who is he?

01:54:09.672 --> 01:54:10.839
-Well...
-He...

01:54:11.172 --> 01:54:13.047
-He is our family friend.
-Oh!

01:54:14.464 --> 01:54:17.547
Hi bro. I am Ritesh.
Orthopedic surgeon. MS from the U.S

01:54:17.814 --> 01:54:19.156
My name is Devadas.

01:54:21.497 --> 01:54:22.611
From Parvati Nagar.

01:54:23.183 --> 01:54:25.425
-Please take a seat.
[laughs]

01:54:26.357 --> 01:54:27.733
Well, where are we?

01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:30.201
Suvasana,
were you in love with anyone before?

01:54:33.887 --> 01:54:35.128
I wasn't in love with anyone.

01:54:52.941 --> 01:54:53.832
Don't you have any common sense?

01:54:54.032 --> 01:54:55.022
-Hey!
-Yeah what?

01:54:55.222 --> 01:54:56.795
This doesn't concern you.

01:54:56.995 --> 01:54:57.702
Go about your business.

01:54:59.005 --> 01:54:59.421
Okay.

01:55:00.308 --> 01:55:02.834
Suvasana. Get up, please.

01:55:06.937 --> 01:55:10.867
[music mutes voice]

01:55:12.464 --> 01:55:14.380
C1, C2, C3, C4 are ok

01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:16.839
Just turn... turn please.

01:55:25.297 --> 01:55:27.641
L1, L2, L3, L4 are ok as well.
[chuckles]

01:55:28.172 --> 01:55:29.920
Just bend... bend please.

01:55:30.499 --> 01:55:31.506
-Bend... Ah!
-Deva!

01:55:32.018 --> 01:55:33.094
-Mr. Devadas...
-Mr. Devadas...

01:55:33.297 --> 01:55:34.634
Mr. Devadas, please wait.

01:55:35.087 --> 01:55:35.783
-Leave him.
-Oh no!

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:36.892
-Mr. Devadas.
-Please.

01:55:37.547 --> 01:55:39.526
Devadas is not just from Parvati Nagar.

01:55:39.726 --> 01:55:41.081
He is Suvasana's lover as well.

01:55:42.214 --> 01:55:42.882
-Oh no!
-Please!

01:55:44.339 --> 01:55:45.474
-Mr. Devadas...
-Mr. Devadas...

01:55:45.617 --> 01:55:46.966
Just stay put. I will
deal with you in a minute.

01:55:48.547 --> 01:55:50.325
Once I lock you up in the prison,

01:55:50.581 --> 01:55:51.367
-then you will...
-Uncle.

01:55:52.089 --> 01:55:54.863
My love for Suvasana is not the
kind that goes away after death.

01:55:55.167 --> 01:55:56.695
It is the kind that never
goes away even after I am killed.

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:01.621
Uncle!

01:56:01.895 --> 01:56:03.528
She cried for milk, at birth.

01:56:04.329 --> 01:56:05.588
Now again she is crying for you.

01:56:05.788 --> 01:56:07.940
For an alcoholic!
That is the reason for anguish!

01:56:09.647 --> 01:56:11.414
Suvasana is mine.

01:56:13.112 --> 01:56:14.679
If you look for other alliances...

01:56:15.034 --> 01:56:16.971
or even try to get her
married to someone else,

01:56:17.530 --> 01:56:19.181
I will do the same thing again.

01:56:20.529 --> 01:56:22.027
Shut up and get out of the house!

01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:30.291
Get out of my house
and get out of my life.

01:56:31.895 --> 01:56:32.414
Go!

01:56:34.404 --> 01:56:35.777
-Go.
[sobs]

01:56:57.779 --> 01:56:58.763
I'm resigning the job.

01:57:00.281 --> 01:57:02.079
Nothing sir. I'm just quiting.

01:57:02.279 --> 01:57:06.440
"She is leaving. She is leaving."

01:57:07.288 --> 01:57:12.104
-"She is leaving me and going away"
-Can you call your sister?

01:57:12.413 --> 01:57:16.820
-"She is leaving. She is leaving."
-Shut the gates.

01:57:17.683 --> 01:57:21.915
"She is leaving me and going away"

01:57:23.695 --> 01:57:26.177
"She is leaving. She is leaving."

01:57:26.445 --> 01:57:28.769
"My dream is leaving my eyes."

01:57:29.062 --> 01:57:31.310
"The rhythm of my
heart is leaving me"

01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:34.724
"The deity is leaving the temple."

01:57:36.627 --> 01:57:39.013
"My smile is leaving my lips."

01:57:39.269 --> 01:57:41.621
"My shadow is leaving me."

01:57:41.861 --> 01:57:45.269
"My desires are leaving my life"

01:57:45.964 --> 01:57:50.467
"She is leaving. She is leaving."

01:57:51.059 --> 01:57:55.395
"She is leaving me and going away."

01:58:23.070 --> 01:58:25.506
"Won't the waves listen to the stories?"

01:58:25.706 --> 01:58:28.066
"Won't the cloud listen to the skies?"

01:58:28.266 --> 01:58:30.690
"Won't the foliage listen to the rain?"

01:58:30.904 --> 01:58:33.275
"Won't the flute listen to
the dictates of the wind?"

01:58:33.487 --> 01:58:35.853
"I am anxious to tell you."

01:58:36.092 --> 01:58:38.437
"You are stubborn in your
refusal to hear me out"

01:58:38.783 --> 01:58:41.015
"Her love is her life"

01:58:41.254 --> 01:58:43.614
"And I fear she might lose
her and life and mine as well"

01:58:47.905 --> 01:58:52.318
"She is leaving, she is leaving"

01:58:53.214 --> 01:58:57.582
"She is leaving me and going away."

01:59:14.654 --> 01:59:15.315
Drink, son.

01:59:17.112 --> 01:59:17.812
Drink up!

01:59:19.112 --> 01:59:20.089
Will you or won't you?

01:59:28.717 --> 01:59:29.541
Will you or won't you?

01:59:31.195 --> 01:59:32.537
Will you or won't you?

01:59:33.012 --> 01:59:35.854
-Just wait a minute. Wait.
-Will you or won't you?

01:59:36.446 --> 01:59:39.608
Son, please drink. Please.

02:00:14.265 --> 02:00:15.589
-Bojja.
-Brother.

02:00:15.789 --> 02:00:16.563
This is a nice house.

02:00:17.195 --> 02:00:19.407
You guys carry on brother.
That little girl will be there inside.

02:00:19.615 --> 02:00:21.012
Little girl? Little girl?

02:00:21.112 --> 02:00:22.496
What is this little girl phobia?

02:00:22.687 --> 02:00:25.123
You go brother. The
little girl will be there.

02:00:25.223 --> 02:00:26.112
-Shut and come.
-I won't come.

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:28.551
'Hi, uncle.'

02:00:30.137 --> 02:00:30.859
Greetings.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.095
-My name is John...
-John Wick.

02:00:43.554 --> 02:00:45.133
Your vehicle number is 0459.

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:47.461
I am the one who
booked you at least 10 times

02:00:47.661 --> 02:00:49.197
in the drink and drive case
and got your license cancelled.

02:00:49.397 --> 02:00:52.201
[laughs]
-That's great. That's great.

02:00:52.464 --> 02:00:55.479
So sorry. I don't remember
anything when I am drunk.

02:00:55.929 --> 02:00:57.141
Tell me what brings you here.

02:00:58.470 --> 02:01:02.060
I am in love with your daughter Suvasana.

02:01:04.262 --> 02:01:07.379
I want to get your
permission for the marriage.

02:01:07.751 --> 02:01:09.187
So, I came here with my friends to

02:01:09.387 --> 02:01:11.026
ask you for her hand in marriage.

02:01:11.226 --> 02:01:13.479
I can guess what kind
of a useless fellow you are

02:01:13.687 --> 02:01:15.398
by the kind of people you hang out with.

02:01:15.598 --> 02:01:16.928
I won't give an alcoholic like you,

02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:19.166
even a glass of water from my house.

02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:20.855
How will I give you my
daughter in marriage?

02:01:20.983 --> 02:01:21.815
Get out. Go!

02:01:22.154 --> 02:01:24.939
Uncle, cool. Please.

02:01:26.095 --> 02:01:27.045
Hey, traffic!

02:01:27.650 --> 02:01:29.033
You forgot to watch your words...

02:01:29.517 --> 02:01:32.735
I am warning you. Give your
daughter in marriage to my brother.

02:01:32.935 --> 02:01:34.406
-Oh...
-If not...

02:01:36.121 --> 02:01:37.279
You know about me right!

02:01:38.137 --> 02:01:39.504
I will just be back.

02:01:39.799 --> 02:01:40.917
I'll stab you.

02:01:41.554 --> 02:01:43.981
Brother, calm down. Leave it to me.

02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:46.715
You there! Don't you know who he is?

02:01:47.019 --> 02:01:48.233
Bojja Nampally.

02:01:48.538 --> 02:01:50.675
He is a beloved friend,
a weapon against the enemies,

02:01:50.931 --> 02:01:52.250
and he is his very own
government in Hyderabad.

02:01:52.450 --> 02:01:53.599
If you don't comply...

02:01:53.799 --> 02:01:55.265
Stop it, Amudam!

02:01:55.465 --> 02:01:56.263
What is this Bojja?

02:01:56.554 --> 02:01:58.282
Uncle's is a soft-core family.

02:02:08.798 --> 02:02:09.692
[screams in pain]

02:02:11.637 --> 02:02:12.853
Who beat him! Oh!

02:02:22.319 --> 02:02:23.069
Oh my!

02:02:23.387 --> 02:02:23.911
Hey Bojja!

02:02:24.962 --> 02:02:25.788
Oh no!

02:02:35.554 --> 02:02:36.186
Dear...

02:02:45.186 --> 02:02:46.421
What the hell is this?

02:02:46.884 --> 02:02:48.219
They're bashing us like hell.

02:02:48.504 --> 02:02:49.244
Oh no!

02:02:54.676 --> 02:02:56.886
Bojja, they are no soft-core family.

02:02:57.086 --> 02:02:58.795
-Yes Bro...
-They are very hard-core.

02:03:00.095 --> 02:03:01.345
[screaming]

02:03:08.621 --> 02:03:10.546
No, uncle. Thank you. No.

02:03:11.465 --> 02:03:12.304
I'll run now!

02:03:14.133 --> 02:03:16.230
You bloody pigs.

02:03:16.595 --> 02:03:19.649
Hey! If you know how to
use a stick, I know karate.

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:21.838
I am fully trained! Come.

02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:23.435
Don't you think we can take you on?

02:03:23.679 --> 02:03:24.370
Come on!

02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:28.179
Didn't you go to the school?

02:03:28.554 --> 02:03:29.615
I didn't know!

02:03:38.236 --> 02:03:39.737
I beg you, please spare me.

02:03:43.902 --> 02:03:45.806
Oh god! She seems very dangerous.

02:03:46.197 --> 02:03:47.895
Oh god! Save me from the little one!

02:03:48.095 --> 02:03:50.899
I wondered what they were on
about when they feared a little girl.

02:03:51.264 --> 02:03:51.842
Brother...

02:03:52.982 --> 02:03:54.668
she is little but she keeps flying
around and kicking the crap out of people.

02:03:56.662 --> 02:03:59.814
oh my god! Brother...
it is difficult to tolerate your

02:03:59.998 --> 02:04:01.563
thrashing compared to that little girl's.

02:04:01.763 --> 02:04:04.168
Close it please, close
it. I am begging you.

02:04:04.595 --> 02:04:05.929
[screaming]

02:04:06.304 --> 02:04:07.060
What's the hell are these beatings?

02:04:07.586 --> 02:04:10.418
All the family got into the fight! Oh no!

02:04:10.579 --> 02:04:12.645
I want Suvasana, Bojja...

02:04:13.656 --> 02:04:14.227
But how!

02:04:16.887 --> 02:04:19.651
It's been many days
since we see you smiling.

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:22.885
The house looks dull.

02:04:26.345 --> 02:04:27.742
Please forget that girl.

02:04:29.167 --> 02:04:30.477
I am begging you.

02:04:34.675 --> 02:04:35.537
[door bell rings]

02:04:36.976 --> 02:04:38.189
[door bell rings]

02:04:44.304 --> 02:04:45.413
Are you Devadasu?

02:04:46.262 --> 02:04:47.887
-Yes.
-Get in the vehicle.

02:04:48.087 --> 02:04:50.063
-Why?
-Just get in the vehicle.

02:04:53.345 --> 02:04:54.222
What happened son?

02:04:57.762 --> 02:04:58.939
Sir... Sir...

02:05:00.042 --> 02:05:01.093
This is my son.

02:05:01.345 --> 02:05:03.604
-What happened?
-Come to the police station to find out.

02:05:04.012 --> 02:05:04.513
Sir...

02:05:05.429 --> 02:05:06.394
What happened, son?

02:05:07.149 --> 02:05:08.518
I will go to the
police station and find out.

02:05:08.997 --> 02:05:10.207
-Son... son...
-You wait here.

02:05:10.249 --> 02:05:11.167
I just got him into the vehicle.

02:05:11.773 --> 02:05:12.622
What charge do you want?

02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:14.581
Just keep him locked in the
police station for two hours.

02:05:15.151 --> 02:05:18.294
You will figure it out yourself later.

02:05:21.845 --> 02:05:22.315
Sir...

02:05:23.679 --> 02:05:24.823
Why did you bring me here?

02:05:25.095 --> 02:05:26.914
Go and sit there.

02:05:42.929 --> 02:05:43.674
Greetings sir.

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.080
Sub-inspector...

02:05:46.137 --> 02:05:46.792
Thank you.

02:05:51.804 --> 02:05:52.965
Sir, greetings.

02:05:55.054 --> 02:05:57.109
Why did you bring my son here?

02:05:58.554 --> 02:06:00.020
Why did you bring my son here?

02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:00.854
-Hey!
-[gasps]

02:06:02.095 --> 02:06:03.775
Do you think you are my superior, eh?

02:06:04.361 --> 02:06:05.901
And, am I obliged to tell you
everything just because you asked me?

02:06:06.495 --> 02:06:07.774
Go and sit there!

02:06:20.828 --> 02:06:22.423
-What happened son?
[phone rings]

02:06:55.137 --> 02:06:56.635
Go and bring fast.

02:07:05.137 --> 02:07:06.261
-What's that?
-Sir.. sir...

02:07:06.461 --> 02:07:07.900
-What's that?
-Hey, give it to me.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.400
Sir, sir... it's time for my son to drink.

02:07:11.637 --> 02:07:14.556
Do you know in which
place are you talking this?

02:07:14.681 --> 02:07:17.009
Sir, my son is an authorized drinker.

02:07:17.455 --> 02:07:18.677
He has a doctor's certificate.

02:07:19.727 --> 02:07:20.523
It doesn't matter what you think.

02:07:21.035 --> 02:07:22.500
He has to drink.

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:25.720
It's time for his
medicine. He has to have it now.

02:07:26.162 --> 02:07:28.435
How dare you do this in the police station
and in front of the police officers?

02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:29.889
You son of a...

02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:37.490
Uncle...

02:09:24.072 --> 02:09:25.104
Take the idiot away!

02:09:26.804 --> 02:09:28.030
Sir... sir... sir...

02:09:28.302 --> 02:09:29.541
Please don't beat him.

02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:31.841
He will die sir.

02:09:33.979 --> 02:09:35.287
Sir... sir...

02:09:37.325 --> 02:09:38.391
Sir, please don't beat him sir...

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:41.067
Brother...

02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:43.972
just because he was
denied drinking for a while,

02:09:44.245 --> 02:09:47.208
he thrashed all the police
personnel in the police station.

02:09:48.171 --> 02:09:49.418
I am going to book an FIR for him.

02:09:49.594 --> 02:09:50.854
No. No.

02:09:51.366 --> 02:09:54.055
I now have a lot more
clarity on his stamina.

02:09:54.812 --> 02:09:57.402
I will pay you and
your station handsomely.

02:09:57.845 --> 02:10:00.036
Just let him go. Let him go.

02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:45.316
"I did not think so"

02:10:45.812 --> 02:10:47.973
"I never ever thought that"

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:52.760
"Half of myself would set
me on fire and burn me"

02:10:53.670 --> 02:10:55.922
"I did not think so"

02:10:56.122 --> 02:10:58.347
"I never ever thought that"

02:10:58.763 --> 02:11:02.855
"Half of myself would set
me on fire and burn me"

02:11:04.951 --> 02:11:06.017
"I did not think so"

02:11:06.225 --> 02:11:07.305
"I never ever thought that"

02:11:07.561 --> 02:11:09.918
"the sadness in my heart
feels alien to my eyes."

02:11:10.158 --> 02:11:12.366
"This anxiousness is
alien to my heart."

02:11:12.611 --> 02:11:15.972
"I am faced with the question
that transcends the topic of love"

02:11:17.762 --> 02:11:20.315
"This is so weight
that my heart can't hold"

02:11:20.515 --> 02:11:22.855
"My emotions fail to turn into words."

02:11:23.095 --> 02:11:26.281
"Something seems to be choking me up"

02:11:27.218 --> 02:11:29.019
"I did not think so"

02:11:29.675 --> 02:11:31.505
"I never ever thought that"

02:11:32.321 --> 02:11:36.694
"Half of myself would
set me on fire and burn me"

02:12:04.178 --> 02:12:06.726
"Did I ask you for gold and treasure?"

02:12:06.926 --> 02:12:09.222
"Did I ask you to get me
awards and accomplishments?"

02:12:09.422 --> 02:12:11.939
"Did I wish for many things from you?"

02:12:12.039 --> 02:12:14.401
"Did I wish for lot of smiles?"

02:12:14.692 --> 02:12:17.050
"Did I ask you to take
on many responsibilities?"

02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:19.549
"Or burden you with my troubles?"

02:12:19.749 --> 02:12:22.205
"Just so that the two
of us can become one"

02:12:22.462 --> 02:12:25.757
"I simply asked you to
let go of one thing."

02:12:28.095 --> 02:12:30.319
Big sister, you love Mr. Devadas so much.

02:12:30.654 --> 02:12:33.073
Why do you keep avoiding him?

02:12:35.317 --> 02:12:37.550
It's because I love him a lot.

02:12:38.495 --> 02:12:39.647
For my love...

02:12:40.283 --> 02:12:44.070
I am of the hope that
he will quit drinking.

02:12:44.421 --> 02:12:45.972
Buddy, I asked the SI numerous times,

02:12:46.744 --> 02:12:47.820
as to why he beat you up.

02:12:48.836 --> 02:12:50.345
No matter how much I asked
him, he refused to say anything.

02:12:51.452 --> 02:12:52.925
Buddy, I smell something fishy.

02:12:54.177 --> 02:12:55.956
I think your father-in-law
might be responsible for this.

02:13:03.327 --> 02:13:04.871
Greetings, greetings...

02:13:05.119 --> 02:13:07.377
With the sole mission of
protecting the environment,

02:13:07.577 --> 02:13:09.210
the Nagarjuna group of schools

02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:11.910
is introducing the new
'Environment Awards'

02:13:12.244 --> 02:13:15.594
To present this award,
the prominent industrialist

02:13:15.794 --> 02:13:18.555
Mr. John Wick has been
invited as the chief guest.

02:13:19.802 --> 02:13:23.452
[applause]

02:13:30.910 --> 02:13:33.943
Let's look at a short
AV about John Wick.

02:13:34.994 --> 02:13:35.665
John wick...

02:13:35.953 --> 02:13:38.523
He is not just a man,
he is an inspiration...

02:13:38.757 --> 02:13:40.433
Through John Wick group of industies,

02:13:40.753 --> 02:13:44.785
Lakhs of people are getting
employment direclty and indirectluy.

02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:47.541
If there is any environmental disaster,

02:13:47.741 --> 02:13:49.223
the first person to step in to help is...

02:13:49.494 --> 02:13:50.230
John Wick.

02:13:50.521 --> 02:13:53.968
That is why,
he spends 50% of his earnings,

02:13:54.168 --> 02:13:57.586
for social sevice through
his John Wick foundation.

02:13:58.687 --> 02:14:03.410
[applause]

02:14:06.535 --> 02:14:08.685
Mr. John Wick, please come to the dais.

02:14:15.087 --> 02:14:16.269
If you raise a dog,

02:14:16.469 --> 02:14:18.052
it safeguards only your house.

02:14:18.252 --> 02:14:19.939
But if you raise a plant,

02:14:20.157 --> 02:14:22.032
it safeguards the entire environment.

02:14:22.351 --> 02:14:24.977
This is the philosophy of
Mr. Kshunakar Rao's family.

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:26.928
That is the reason
why this family deserves

02:14:27.128 --> 02:14:30.032
the prestigious Nagarjuna Group
of School's Environment Award.

02:14:30.232 --> 02:14:32.577
Please welcome Mr. Kshunakar
Rao and his family

02:14:32.827 --> 02:14:33.990
onto the dais.

02:14:34.190 --> 02:14:37.910
[applause]

02:14:43.586 --> 02:14:45.883
We invite Mr. John Wick
to address the audience.

02:14:48.744 --> 02:14:50.460
-Hello, everyone.
[camera capture]

02:14:50.827 --> 02:14:53.122
I am donating ten crores...

02:14:53.322 --> 02:14:56.432
...to the CM relief fund for
the victims of Kerala flood.

02:14:58.731 --> 02:15:01.917
I wish for Mr. Kshunakar Rao to help
me donate that money to the relief fund.

02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:07.202
-Me! Why me?
-Uncle...

02:15:07.494 --> 02:15:10.769
If someone as dignified and a
good Samaritan like you helps

02:15:11.017 --> 02:15:12.872
I feel that it elevates the cause further.

02:15:13.312 --> 02:15:13.869
Please...

02:15:17.223 --> 02:15:17.937
Uncle,

02:15:18.293 --> 02:15:21.077
You will understand this
award function plan tomorrow.

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:26.509
Hello...

02:15:29.309 --> 02:15:29.753
Ah!

02:15:30.025 --> 02:15:31.184
-Hello
-It's Mr. John Wick!

02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:33.175
Please. Come on.

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:35.536
-Mrs. Sukshma, get some coffee.
-I'll just do that.

02:15:35.636 --> 02:15:36.770
-Please come...
-Oh, no, no!

02:15:36.970 --> 02:15:37.765
No formalities please.

02:15:39.717 --> 02:15:42.002
I just came here to
apologise for my misbehaviour.

02:15:42.071 --> 02:15:43.948
Not at all Mr. John wick.
Come in, please. Sit down.

02:15:44.168 --> 02:15:45.323
Come in, come on.

02:15:47.704 --> 02:15:50.210
Uncle, I will come to the point, directly.

02:15:50.731 --> 02:15:53.464
Miss. Suvasana, please sit down.

02:15:54.496 --> 02:15:55.187
Please sit.

02:15:55.717 --> 02:15:57.473
Come sit.

02:16:01.733 --> 02:16:07.294
If I ever wanted to get married,
there is no dearth of women.

02:16:07.494 --> 02:16:08.018
But...

02:16:08.467 --> 02:16:10.663
when I saw Suvasana,
I liked her instantly.

02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:15.592
You keep forgetting the many
good things I do during the day

02:16:16.175 --> 02:16:19.587
and only remember that
I drink during the nights.

02:16:20.217 --> 02:16:21.057
I will quit alcohol, uncle.

02:16:21.705 --> 02:16:24.161
I will quit alcohol for Suvasana.

02:16:25.134 --> 02:16:27.689
Even with no one's
support, I achieved a lot.

02:16:28.092 --> 02:16:32.060
If I get Suvasana as my life companion...

02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:33.272
imagine the great number of
things I can accomplish...

02:16:33.768 --> 02:16:36.890
and the many people I can
help with her by my side.

02:16:38.106 --> 02:16:40.798
Please... accept my love.

02:16:41.228 --> 02:16:41.770
Please.

02:16:43.852 --> 02:16:45.266
What else is there to think?

02:16:45.592 --> 02:16:50.412
You and John Wick share the
same goal of helping people.

02:16:50.925 --> 02:16:52.642
There is some truth in
his love for your daughter.

02:16:52.890 --> 02:16:54.560
He seems to be very
sincere in his ardent plea.

02:16:55.425 --> 02:16:59.511
I don't think we can find a better
match than him for our daughter.

02:17:01.953 --> 02:17:02.837
Ok, Mr. John Wick.

02:17:04.101 --> 02:17:06.133
We will find out an auspicious
day and confirm the wedding.

02:17:06.333 --> 02:17:08.590
-Thank you, uncle! Thank you so much!
-Mr. John Wick, what is this?

02:17:08.918 --> 02:17:10.878
-It's okay Mr. John Wick...
-Thank you!

02:17:12.060 --> 02:17:12.772
Father...

02:17:13.804 --> 02:17:15.254
I have Devadas in my heart.

02:17:16.931 --> 02:17:19.705
I am in love with him.

02:17:20.134 --> 02:17:22.075
You are in love with Devadas?

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:24.618
Mr. John Wick, sit down.

02:17:29.038 --> 02:17:29.527
Sit down.

02:17:32.135 --> 02:17:34.605
Ms. Suvasana, please sit down.

02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:38.206
The plan is worked out.

02:17:38.406 --> 02:17:38.854
Uncle...

02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.053
The girl I want to get married to
should have only me in her heart.

02:17:43.278 --> 02:17:47.140
But,
your daughter's is in love with Devadas.

02:17:47.384 --> 02:17:52.772
So, I am of the opinion that
you should give her a chance.

02:17:54.403 --> 02:17:56.584
Both Devadas and I drink.

02:17:57.092 --> 02:17:59.947
Mine is a habit but his is an addiction.

02:18:00.259 --> 02:18:03.812
To make your daughter
happy, I will quit drinking.

02:18:03.912 --> 02:18:07.690
Ask Devadas to do that for at
least a day. I mean just a day.

02:18:10.505 --> 02:18:14.195
If he cannot do that,
Suvasana should get married to me.

02:18:15.603 --> 02:18:18.243
Ms. Suvasana,
are you okay with this proposition?

02:18:23.302 --> 02:18:25.055
Suvasana is mine.

02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:30.480
If you look for further matches or try to
get her married to someone else either,

02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:32.774
I will do the same thing again!

02:18:35.814 --> 02:18:36.887
I am okay with this proposal.

02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:39.048
-Thank you, uncle. Thank you.
-Okay...

02:18:39.925 --> 02:18:40.857
-Ms. Aveshita...
-Yes?

02:18:41.441 --> 02:18:43.296
Ask Mr. Devadasu to come here immediately.

02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:44.432
Alright father.

02:18:44.925 --> 02:18:45.948
Oh God! Davadas is coming...

02:18:46.148 --> 02:18:47.647
Big bro, it's stuffy here.

02:18:47.847 --> 02:18:48.840
-Let's go and sit under the tree.
-Wait man!

02:18:49.092 --> 02:18:52.574
Bro, that's right. I am
sweating too. I will go too.

02:18:52.674 --> 02:18:54.502
-Hey, Bojja. Bojja!
-Move! See you later, bro!

02:18:54.602 --> 02:18:55.669
Hey, Bojja!

02:19:01.607 --> 02:19:03.956
-You! Why are you here?
-Oh goodness! He is here.

02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:05.814
-Why are you here?
-Mr. Devadas...

02:19:06.342 --> 02:19:08.423
Stop...
Mr. John Wick has a proposition to make.

02:19:08.759 --> 02:19:09.798
And all of us like it.

02:19:10.314 --> 02:19:14.630
The thing is... if you can
stay off alcohol for just one day,

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:18.074
I am ready to give my
daughter in marriage to you.

02:19:18.611 --> 02:19:20.117
Are you okay with this?

02:19:23.592 --> 02:19:24.663
Mr. Devadas...

02:19:25.752 --> 02:19:30.916
Both of us will meet up in a place,
that is completely filled with alcohol.

02:19:31.246 --> 02:19:33.318
We have to stay in control without
opening a single bottle of liquor,

02:19:33.453 --> 02:19:35.495
without paying any attention
to what's going on around us

02:19:35.696 --> 02:19:37.945
and stay sober for 24 hours.

02:19:38.386 --> 02:19:42.386
If you can do that, Suvasana is yours.

02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:45.630
If not, she is mine.

02:19:47.102 --> 02:19:49.498
-Are you ready Mr. Devadas?
-What do you mean ready?

02:19:49.888 --> 02:19:50.960
-Who the hell are you?
-Mr. Devadas!

02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:52.634
Who the hell are you to give
me these kinds of propositions?

02:19:53.092 --> 02:19:55.370
If you stay another minute in front of
me, I don't know what I would do to you.

02:19:55.470 --> 02:19:56.238
-Get lost!
-Mr. Devadas Please!

02:19:57.175 --> 02:20:00.098
-Ok, uncle. No problem. No problem
-Please.

02:20:01.425 --> 02:20:02.639
-Bye uncle. I shall take my leave.
-Okay.

02:20:03.077 --> 02:20:04.080
-Bye aunty.
-Get lost!

02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:07.055
Okay...

02:20:11.425 --> 02:20:12.116
Listen, uncle...

02:20:12.595 --> 02:20:15.008
If you can understand my love
for your daughter marry her to me.

02:20:15.842 --> 02:20:18.425
But, don't bring losers and put conditions
and try to make it a competition.

02:20:24.175 --> 02:20:27.102
I heard and saw many great love stories.

02:20:28.622 --> 02:20:34.296
I saw people leaving their parents, wealth
and even lives for the sake of their love.

02:20:35.550 --> 02:20:38.509
But, he is not even able to sacrifice
his addiction for the sake of love.

02:20:41.217 --> 02:20:43.092
Is he really in love with you?

02:20:44.050 --> 02:20:45.868
Give it a thought, Ms. Suvasana.

02:20:58.342 --> 02:21:00.270
I am here to try and understand your love.

02:21:01.842 --> 02:21:03.273
How do you want me to understand you?

02:21:05.384 --> 02:21:07.070
How do you want me to understand you?

02:21:08.592 --> 02:21:09.426
Speak!

02:21:11.384 --> 02:21:14.658
You came to my house, sat in
front of my parents and drank liquor.

02:21:15.217 --> 02:21:16.717
Do you know how hurt would he be?

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:18.429
Even after this behaviour of yours...

02:21:18.629 --> 02:21:21.315
I shamelessly confessed my
love for you in front of all.

02:21:21.717 --> 02:21:22.755
What did you do?

02:21:24.884 --> 02:21:26.050
You made me a fool.

02:21:27.259 --> 02:21:29.467
You made me a fool in front of all!

02:21:30.634 --> 02:21:33.800
Can't you stop drinking for a day for me?

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:39.134
Will you die if you don't drink for a day?

02:21:42.009 --> 02:21:43.675
Yes, I will die.

02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:46.130
Then die!

02:22:05.967 --> 02:22:08.677
Even my death is not worthy of you.

02:22:08.877 --> 02:22:10.050
Hey!

02:22:10.634 --> 02:22:12.842
I will accept that challenge for you.

02:22:17.634 --> 02:22:21.009
"In a life time of hundred years,"

02:22:22.050 --> 02:22:23.871
"In a life time of hundred years,"

02:22:24.071 --> 02:22:25.884
"30 years are spent sleeping."

02:22:27.467 --> 02:22:31.634
"20 years are spent in studies.
20 years are spent in the office."

02:22:32.634 --> 02:22:36.469
"10 years are spent in the traffic.
10 years are spent in shopping."

02:22:36.669 --> 02:22:40.517
"9 years are spent in bars,
bathrooms and cell phones."

02:22:40.717 --> 02:22:45.705
"At last we are left with... only a year."

02:22:46.076 --> 02:22:46.873
"What? Only a year?"

02:22:47.167 --> 02:22:50.668
"Only a year. That is all."

02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:07.009
"In a life time of hundred
years, 30 years are spent sleeping."

02:23:10.342 --> 02:23:14.009
"20 years are spent in studies.
20 years are spent in the office."

02:23:17.342 --> 02:23:20.616
"10 years are spent in the traffic.
10 years are spent in shopping."

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:24.105
"9 years are spent in bars,
bathrooms and cell phones."

02:23:24.384 --> 02:23:27.884
"At last we are left with... only a year."

02:23:29.884 --> 02:23:30.975
"What? Only a year?"

02:23:31.175 --> 02:23:33.073
"That is all you get, you..."

02:23:33.173 --> 02:23:35.300
"Use it."

02:23:36.435 --> 02:23:39.715
"Use it. Use that time"

02:23:39.923 --> 02:23:43.069
"Use it. Use that age"

02:23:43.526 --> 02:23:46.668
"If you get an
opportunity, don't miss out on it."

02:23:47.068 --> 02:23:50.092
"Use it. Use that time."

02:23:50.467 --> 02:23:53.522
"Use it. Use that age."

02:24:03.675 --> 02:24:06.858
"Use it."

02:24:21.634 --> 02:24:24.872
"If there is only one
throw, make a century out of it."

02:24:25.175 --> 02:24:28.532
"If there is even a small
gap, squeeze through it."

02:24:28.732 --> 02:24:31.988
"If you get a paper
boat, sail the Pacific Ocean"

02:24:32.188 --> 02:24:35.450
"If you only have candle
light, challenge the sun light."

02:24:35.842 --> 02:24:39.159
"Life is very short
but the goals are big."

02:24:39.359 --> 02:24:42.442
"Life is very short
but the goals are huge."

02:24:42.759 --> 02:24:45.907
"What you seek is in front of you."

02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:51.238
"What is it?"

02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:52.611
"Time... It's the time dude!"

02:24:52.967 --> 02:24:55.894
"Use it. Use that time."

02:24:56.423 --> 02:24:59.500
"Use it. Use that age."

02:25:28.446 --> 02:25:30.054
Yes! He has fainted!

02:25:34.342 --> 02:25:37.209
-Bro, he has fainted
-He fell at last!

02:26:01.259 --> 02:26:04.602
"If the lovers are in sync,
just half an hour is enough."

02:26:04.802 --> 02:26:08.165
"If we let go of past and future,
even quarter of an hour is enough."

02:26:08.365 --> 02:26:11.594
"When you and I are one,
even a minute is enough."

02:26:11.794 --> 02:26:15.017
"And we both feel the
same, even a second is enough."

02:26:15.384 --> 02:26:18.678
"Life is short,
and the love we feel is huge."

02:26:18.884 --> 02:26:22.199
"Life is short,
and the love we feel is huge."

02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:25.697
"The time spent in love is really great."

02:26:27.592 --> 02:26:28.935
"Wow!"

02:26:29.135 --> 02:26:32.129
"Use it."

02:26:32.629 --> 02:26:35.747
"Use it. Use that time."

02:26:35.969 --> 02:26:38.951
"Use it. Use that age."

02:26:39.467 --> 02:26:42.885
"If you get an
opportunity, don't miss out on it."

02:26:43.187 --> 02:26:49.187
"Use it. Use it dude. Use it."

02:26:50.074 --> 02:26:50.936
[thud]

02:27:06.509 --> 02:27:10.795
-Hey!
-We'll kill him if anyone speaks.

02:27:11.174 --> 02:27:11.681
Sit down!

02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:16.062
Oh no! Why did the family rise now?

02:27:16.345 --> 02:27:18.507
He is a drunkard.
He is in some tiff or the other.

02:27:18.707 --> 02:27:20.823
They will take care of it
themselves. Let it be. Sit down.

02:27:21.342 --> 02:27:21.926
Sit down.

02:27:32.548 --> 02:27:33.039
Hey you!

02:27:35.175 --> 02:27:37.342
-Son!
-Sir... Sir... Please don't hit him!

02:27:39.092 --> 02:27:40.467
How dare you hit my friend?

02:27:41.878 --> 02:27:43.252
[groans]

02:27:44.425 --> 02:27:47.420
How dare all of you single
my son out and attack him?

02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:49.316
If you are men enough,
let him drink and then let's see.

02:27:56.967 --> 02:28:00.759
-Sir... Sir... Please... Don't hit him.
-Son, take it.

02:28:01.842 --> 02:28:03.217
-Sir... sir... sir...
-I'll kill you.

02:28:07.021 --> 02:28:08.104
Dear Suvasana...

02:28:08.362 --> 02:28:11.287
My son won't die because someone hits him.

02:28:12.384 --> 02:28:15.649
He will die if he doesn't drink.

02:28:16.657 --> 02:28:20.742
I am begging you. He loves you very much.

02:28:21.384 --> 02:28:22.967
No... no... no...

02:28:23.762 --> 02:28:27.877
He is ready to sacrifice himself
for you. Please understand dear.

02:28:28.217 --> 02:28:29.920
Sir... sir... sir...

02:28:30.486 --> 02:28:33.425
If children drink and come home,
there are parents who thrash them up.

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:37.998
We are the kind of parents who thrashed
him up if he didn't drink alcohol.

02:28:38.538 --> 02:28:40.439
Sir, he has to drink
alcohol three times a day.

02:28:40.707 --> 02:28:42.633
If he misses a single dose...

02:28:44.259 --> 02:28:45.621
he will die.

02:28:48.244 --> 02:28:49.628
Won't you try to understand my problem?

02:28:49.828 --> 02:28:51.800
Suvasana, listen to me once. Please.

02:28:52.009 --> 02:28:53.236
That's not it... Suvasana, listen...

02:28:53.509 --> 02:28:55.321
Will you die if you don't drink for a day?

02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:57.498
Yes, I will.

02:28:58.917 --> 02:29:02.039
He has Fetal alcohol syndrome disorder.

02:29:02.509 --> 02:29:03.250
She is the one who is responsible...

02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:09.160
Don't know which star we wished
upon, she wanted a son like Devadas.

02:29:09.717 --> 02:29:12.992
He really is going to die
like Devadas for the sake of love.

02:29:43.379 --> 02:29:44.091
Suvasana...

02:29:47.441 --> 02:29:48.354
-Bojja,
-Brother?

02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:49.912
-what is she doing?
-Don't know...

02:30:12.009 --> 02:30:12.705
Suvasana!

02:30:14.648 --> 02:30:15.561
What's this now?

02:30:15.879 --> 02:30:16.544
Uncle...

02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:22.516
[groans and coughs]

02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:27.164
[Suvasana groans]

02:30:52.050 --> 02:30:54.580
Dear lord. Damn it!

02:31:16.052 --> 02:31:16.501
[Devadas groans]

02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:35.694
What a kiss, madam!

02:31:37.231 --> 02:31:39.142
Give me a kiss as well.

02:31:39.242 --> 02:31:39.679
Sheshu...

02:31:39.951 --> 02:31:40.964
Just a kiss, madam.

02:31:41.783 --> 02:31:42.763
Just a kiss...

02:31:42.963 --> 02:31:43.708
-Hey...
-Look at him...

02:31:44.039 --> 02:31:45.595
-Sheshu... Sheshu...
-Please madam.

02:31:46.175 --> 02:31:48.672
Don't you know why I brought
you with me? What are you doing?

02:31:48.987 --> 02:31:49.960
Give me a kiss, madam.

02:31:50.168 --> 02:31:52.929
Sheshu, she is going to
be my wife. My fiance.

02:31:53.542 --> 02:31:54.006
[roars]

02:31:59.857 --> 02:32:01.246
-Hey!
-No need brother.

02:32:02.217 --> 02:32:03.415
My son is up now.

02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:16.118
[whistles]

02:32:20.778 --> 02:32:21.932
Do you want a kiss?

02:32:22.664 --> 02:32:23.557
-Come then.
-Hey!

02:33:48.884 --> 02:33:49.618
[gasps]

02:33:51.851 --> 02:33:53.082
Why did he stab him?

02:33:53.634 --> 02:33:55.603
I told you he is a bloody psycho.

02:34:02.943 --> 02:34:04.032
[chuckles]
-Brother...

02:34:04.925 --> 02:34:08.412
I came here to settle your
account, but you settled my account.

02:34:09.298 --> 02:34:11.037
[laughs]
-Yes. It's true.

02:34:11.394 --> 02:34:13.393
-I'll settle your account too.
[knife swishes]

02:34:17.009 --> 02:34:19.543
-I am getting out of here.
-Me too.

02:34:20.050 --> 02:34:22.122
Now, I'm just left with you.

02:34:22.322 --> 02:34:23.156
[knife swishes]

02:34:28.206 --> 02:34:29.604
[groans]

02:34:32.761 --> 02:34:34.184
-Hey!
[knife swishes]

02:34:39.972 --> 02:34:42.679
Whoohoo!

02:34:49.217 --> 02:34:49.879
Come...

02:34:51.259 --> 02:34:51.848
Come...

02:34:53.062 --> 02:34:54.523
Hey!
[glass bottle breaks]

02:34:55.563 --> 02:34:58.653
[groans]
[glass bottles breaks]

02:35:28.772 --> 02:35:29.329
[Aveshita whistles]

02:35:34.384 --> 02:35:37.604
-Give me 180ml bottle please.
-Please. Three 90 ml for me!

02:35:37.754 --> 02:35:38.921
-Three 90 ml for me!
-Who keeps pushing me?

02:35:39.021 --> 02:35:39.817
-Three 90 ml for me!
-Huh!

02:35:40.017 --> 02:35:44.540
Sir, you? At the wine shop? Buying liquor?

02:35:45.384 --> 02:35:49.628
My son-in-law demanded I buy him
a drink before his first night.

02:35:49.828 --> 02:35:51.539
[laughs]
[glass bottles clinks]

02:35:51.745 --> 02:35:54.047
-Your son-in-law is your perfect match!
-Thank you.

02:35:54.701 --> 02:35:58.156
[kaaps singing]

02:36:08.592 --> 02:36:09.955
Hey! What is that?

02:36:10.436 --> 02:36:11.511
This is a new tradition.

02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:15.413
They say husband and
wife share everything.

02:36:15.842 --> 02:36:16.452
So...

02:36:17.081 --> 02:36:17.782
Aha!

02:36:20.794 --> 02:36:21.231
Hey!

02:36:30.194 --> 02:36:31.320
Now this is 90ml.
