WEBVTT

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:09.640
Run fast. Catch him.

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.424
Hey stop!

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:35.550
You go there, and you go this way.

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:51.438
Who is that inside?

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:53.099
Nobody is here.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.511
Come out.

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:55.910
I don't come.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.676
You only come in, if you want.

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:04.165
He seems, a crazy boy.

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:11.915
Everyone afraid of darkness,
isn't it?

00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:19.420
They afraid of darkness
than the visibility.

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:21.487
Why didn't you entrust me to them?

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:22.889
Because you trusted me.

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:29.363
What about your parents?

00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:30.415
No.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.857
House?
- This only.

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:37.962
You work under me?

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:40.010
I don't work under anyone.

00:02:40.183 --> 00:02:42.695
I'll work together if you want.

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:47.269
What is your name?
- Deva.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.367
Deva.

00:03:54.763 --> 00:03:56.597
ANANTGIRI HILLS

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.664
All of you should remember one thing.

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:03.929
All of you have to abide
by one opinion before Dada.

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:08.511
Abide by means not to stand.

00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.554
Sit.

00:04:10.532 --> 00:04:13.145
It seems, they are going
to feel down on the feet.

00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:19.894
Don't forget that you
came up holding my legs only.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:22.782
What liquor brother?

00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:25.377
We came here when Seth called me.

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:29.339
You don't have enough
courage to come to the meeting

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:31.982
and he doesn't have enough
dare to come to the settlement.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.068
Who arranged it?

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:36.576
Perfect Dada.

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:39.929
Perfect.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:44.518
Perfect.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.478
Now I understood how you
are ruling since thirty years.

00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:50.796
Greetings.

00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:52.754
Nice to meet you.

00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:56.931
What is the work with
us for a businessman?

00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:01.210
Nothing Dada,
I'm going to start a new business.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.527
Of course, it is illegal.

00:05:03.628 --> 00:05:05.748
I want to start it in Hyderabad.

00:05:06.202 --> 00:05:08.665
I heard that I have to
pay fifty percent for that?

00:05:10.535 --> 00:05:12.232
There is no problem in taking

00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:15.414
ten percent if you want.

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:17.215
These are involved mutual benefits.

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:20.349
Lets it make it cooperate
guys leaving the old style.

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:23.532
All of us decided the same.

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:27.530
Who are you to decide
and who are they to accept?

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.814
Then, who will decide?

00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:35.967
Didn't you know that
since you knew this much?

00:05:36.047 --> 00:05:37.012
Deva.

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.319
Deva.

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:44.630
Have you ever seen
Deva any one of you?

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:46.600
Have you seen him?

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:50.649
Don't know how appears
and where he lives?

00:05:50.866 --> 00:05:54.496
Not even your own son who
left the city ten years ago.

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:57.780
Here he controls us?

00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:00.867
I'll give you a deal.

00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.248
Make your son to sit in the chair.

00:06:05.857 --> 00:06:07.036
Not ten.

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:10.053
I'll give you twenty percent.

00:06:10.861 --> 00:06:12.344
Have you finished?

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:15.826
The problem is not about percentage?

00:06:16.983 --> 00:06:18.267
It's about the work you do.

00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:19.900
Deva will not accept it.

00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:21.179
All of you leave now.

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.980
Okay, call Deva,
I'll talk with him only.

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:26.354
Should Deva comes for you?

00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:29.028
You seem a little boy.

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:30.910
Go and do your business.

00:06:32.155 --> 00:06:33.788
Then, how will he comes?

00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:36.755
Will he come if we kill you?

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:02.694
He is not like him.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.180
He is very crazy than me.

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:12.068
It is better to keep him far.

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:16.305
It will be a great
danger if he will connect.

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.123
Dad.

00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:47.742
Deva

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.801
he will come now.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.694
Is any doctor here?

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.704
Is any doctor here sir?

00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:00.107
Is any doctor is available here sir?

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.517
Is any doctor available here?
- No.

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:03.108
Any doctor is here?

00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:04.624
My person is suffering
from severe pains.

00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:05.843
Is there any doctor available here?

00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:12.680
Is any doctor available here?

00:08:27.348 --> 00:08:28.737
Where is the patient?

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:30.823
In red car.

00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:34.004
Don't worry.
Sleep backward.

00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:35.155
Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:36.362
Why are you forcing me?
- I'll take care.

00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:37.364
Push.

00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:47.522
Sir, it is in this car.

00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:57.753
It's a baby girl.

00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.998
Are you still watching the TV?
Switch off the TV.

00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:46.974
Let's go.

00:09:47.857 --> 00:09:48.914
Hi, sister-in-law!

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:51.256
Uncle came, uncle came.

00:09:51.638 --> 00:09:53.730
Raju, are you?
I thought it is Auto driver?

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.574
How are you sister-in-law?

00:09:54.654 --> 00:09:56.297
One shouldn't ask 'how
are you?' in the metro city.

00:09:56.377 --> 00:09:58.479
You will get the sin if you ask.
- No school today.

00:09:58.559 --> 00:09:59.465
I'll hide.

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:02.044
Always wanted to escape
the school with silly reasons?

00:10:02.343 --> 00:10:03.952
You will become a
MBBS Doctor like uncle

00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:05.549
if you study well going to school.

00:10:05.629 --> 00:10:07.849
Otherwise, you would have opened
a medical shop like your father.

00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:10.373
I'm a holder of M.S gold medal
too sister-in-law. - Really?

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:12.766
Uncle see, I have a fever.

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:14.269
Sit, don't play such dramas.

00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:17.097
You know what your
uncle brought for you?

00:10:18.508 --> 00:10:22.875
I played with this doll long ago.
Buy a gun for me uncle.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.628
I'll buy a gun for you when
I receive the first month salary.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:25.742
Okay.

00:10:26.687 --> 00:10:28.237
Where is brother, sister-in-law?

00:10:28.973 --> 00:10:30.036
Brother!

00:10:31.287 --> 00:10:33.524
Dear Dasu, when did you come?

00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:34.642
Come here.

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:37.105
You said that you will come
at 4 o' clock early in the morning?

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:39.729
You don't use phone
when I want to call you.

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:41.866
I can't use the phone
which has lot of radiation.

00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:43.509
Why the late?

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:46.873
You gave this ointment
when I asked for motion.

00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:49.136
What is this the motions are
not suppressed though I applied it?

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:51.863
You gave an ointment?
- I gave it in a hurry.

00:10:51.988 --> 00:10:53.078
He should have asked it properly.

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:54.611
I don't know where he has applied it?

00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:57.971
Okay, I'll give tablets.

00:10:58.392 --> 00:11:00.819
Take it with buttermilk
in your mouth.

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:02.836
Take this.
- You apply it.

00:11:02.978 --> 00:11:04.081
Because you did like this only

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:05.305
people sent you here
by cancelling your lisence.

00:11:05.385 --> 00:11:07.854
You would have started the other
business instead of medical shop.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:10.153
This the gift given by our elders.

00:11:10.233 --> 00:11:12.801
There is no development even for spoon
except boasting about the history.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.571
Listen to me.
What I'm saying is...

00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:16.711
my medical shop will
be existing beside your clinic

00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:19.884
if you start a clinic here only like
the tea shop beside the pan shop.

00:11:19.964 --> 00:11:21.528
You will send the patients to me.

00:11:21.608 --> 00:11:22.880
Both of us will be settled.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.981
Clinic?
- Yes.

00:11:25.609 --> 00:11:26.588
Hospital.

00:11:27.513 --> 00:11:29.505
I'm going to join a
hospital tomorrow morning.

00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:32.373
You know how it would be?

00:12:22.802 --> 00:12:24.109
Hello.
- Hello.

00:12:24.592 --> 00:12:26.013
The lift will not come
if you press like that?

00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:27.974
Then?
- It will come to your hands.

00:12:30.454 --> 00:12:32.710
This is staff lift.
The patient's lift is there.

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:36.305
You don't know?
I'm a doctor, new join.

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:37.827
I'm Dr Das, MS, General surgeon.

00:12:37.907 --> 00:12:40.904
Oh!
I'm Dr Kuchipudi, a psychiatrist.

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:43.738
What is this sir, the lift is stayed
at 5th floor for the last 5 minutes?

00:12:43.818 --> 00:12:46.618
In fact, it is there only
since half an hour. I'm here only.

00:12:46.978 --> 00:12:48.251
Then, let's go in the patient's lift.

00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:50.145
As per the legal...
- Let's go sir.

00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:52.808
Robotic surgeon.

00:12:52.888 --> 00:12:55.510
Our country is a country
which worship the doctors as Gods.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.741
There is only one doctor
available for every 921 persons.

00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:01.198
After ten years, we require another
2 million doctor in our country.

00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:03.017
He is Doctor Bhardwaj.

00:13:03.097 --> 00:13:05.348
The only answer is
Robots to fill the gap.

00:13:05.428 --> 00:13:08.926
So now, I'm feeling
very proud to announce

00:13:09.006 --> 00:13:11.996
medimax is going to launch
the very first robotic surgery

00:13:12.076 --> 00:13:13.990
on coronary heart diseases in India.

00:13:14.537 --> 00:13:15.505
Thank you.

00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:18.472
Wow.
- Thank you.

00:13:19.484 --> 00:13:20.630
Excuse me sir.

00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:25.012
Yes. - There are some
faults in your lecture sir.

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:30.213
Robotic surgery has
already launched in India

00:13:30.293 --> 00:13:31.621
eight months back at Ahmedabad.

00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:33.182
They only launched it first.

00:13:33.262 --> 00:13:34.898
Yes, yes. I think I forgot that.

00:13:36.143 --> 00:13:38.560
That's why, what I'm going to say is

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.410
first time we are
launching in Hyderabad, yes.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.482
No sir.
Last time also, you...

00:13:43.562 --> 00:13:46.119
You think it is a program of finding
out the faults to get a prize?

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:47.751
Why are you exciting?
Sit here.

00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:48.780
Sir, it is a knowledge sharing.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.273
All of the students
will learn about it sir.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.512
Are they students?
- No.

00:13:52.778 --> 00:13:54.023
It is a press meet.

00:13:55.914 --> 00:13:57.404
Are they press?

00:14:00.497 --> 00:14:03.209
Doctor Das, University topper.

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:05.950
I'm a gold medalist too sir.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.579
More than hundred
gold medalists are here.

00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:10.447
What a pity, what a pity?

00:14:10.527 --> 00:14:14.522
You would have failed if
you have a common sense subject.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.279
Sorry sir, I didn't know
that it was a press meet.

00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:19.489
Mr Das, we are doctors.

00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:22.858
Without diagnose,
we shouldn't confirm the disease.

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:25.339
Our tongue shouldn't be
slipped without thinking properly.

00:14:25.419 --> 00:14:26.397
Okay sir.

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:30.494
Do your duty at least sincerely.

00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:33.746
It is your appointment
and you can join tomorrow.

00:14:34.738 --> 00:14:36.371
I'll join now only sir.

00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:37.656
As you wish.

00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:39.394
It is block 'c'.
- Thank you sir.

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:42.926
'C' block, C block.

00:14:44.315 --> 00:14:45.361
'C' block.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.759
What happened?
One minute, tell me what happened?

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:51.392
He drank the hot
milk without listening.

00:14:51.472 --> 00:14:53.135
He also swallowed
the areca nut with milk.

00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:55.382
He became tight like a drumstick.

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.667
Hold this paper.

00:14:57.553 --> 00:14:58.605
Oh no!

00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:00.332
Mr Doctor.

00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:04.522
What he is doing?

00:15:04.602 --> 00:15:06.799
Sir actual... - Bring the stethoscope
and get the table ready.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:08.653
Why stethoscope?
- Do what I say.

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:10.680
Someone of you press his neck.

00:15:12.998 --> 00:15:14.039
Listen to me once.

00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:16.401
One second is enough for going
away the breath. - But...

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.427
Doctor, give your
stethoscope for one second.

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:24.939
What are you doing?

00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:39.915
I'm sorry

00:15:40.531 --> 00:15:41.804
it's too late.

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:43.894
He is dead.
- Enough.

00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:45.714
It is three hours
now after his death.

00:15:45.794 --> 00:15:48.240
What a doctor are you
telling that he died now.

00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:49.762
Three hours now?

00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:51.512
If he is alive only, you
have to bring him for the treatment

00:15:51.592 --> 00:15:52.445
otherwise, take him to the mortuary.

00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:54.064
They brought to the mortuary only.

00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:55.766
This is are you saying that
it is mortuary? It's a 'C' block.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:57.662
'C' block is mortuary only.

00:16:01.258 --> 00:16:02.531
Is it mortuary?

00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:03.700
No.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.653
You seem, you did lot of operations
soon as you joined in the hospital?

00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:13.085
You are in the same flow?

00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:14.372
Not ordinarily.

00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:17.084
How many patients have consulted you?
- Approximately forty.

00:16:19.497 --> 00:16:20.805
That many?

00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:21.960
What's their problem?

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.933
They don't say anything
opening their mouths.

00:16:24.013 --> 00:16:25.316
We cannot understand that.

00:16:29.017 --> 00:16:30.989
I'll bring also one for you.

00:16:31.771 --> 00:16:33.411
I'm in a bad mood.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.967
I'm going to the beach.

00:16:35.397 --> 00:16:36.774
Sit at shore only.

00:16:36.854 --> 00:16:37.748
Don't go into the water.

00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:39.231
When did the beach
constructed in Hyderabad?

00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:41.105
That's true.
I thought it is Vizag.

00:16:41.327 --> 00:16:44.032
Go to the Hussain sagar if you want.
It looks nice.

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:45.527
Why going in such a night?

00:16:45.607 --> 00:16:47.423
The work pressure will
be like that to the males.

00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.430
I too feel to flee
to Himalayaa sometimes.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.675
Shall I arrange the bag for that?

00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:55.666
Okay, background is okay.

00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:59.549
Sir, shoot is going on.

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:01.659
Can you please go out from the frame?

00:17:01.739 --> 00:17:02.711
Make it fast.

00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:04.711
Lights on, lights on.
- Lights on.

00:17:05.797 --> 00:17:07.596
Okay, Okay, background is ready.

00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:10.252
Sound.

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:12.578
Camera.
- Rolling.

00:17:12.942 --> 00:17:13.936
Action.

00:18:58.037 --> 00:19:00.510
Don't shoot. Catch him.
- Okay sir. Okay sir.

00:19:04.235 --> 00:19:05.704
Hey stop.

00:19:05.784 --> 00:19:07.135
Stop there.

00:19:07.544 --> 00:19:08.873
Catch him.

00:19:17.337 --> 00:19:18.649
Deva coming to city?

00:19:18.786 --> 00:19:19.924
When will he come and how?

00:19:20.004 --> 00:19:21.288
Sir, I don't know.

00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:22.491
Give me the gun.

00:19:22.571 --> 00:19:24.346
Leave me sir.
- Do you know or not?

00:19:24.426 --> 00:19:25.796
I don't know anything sir.

00:19:28.844 --> 00:19:30.394
You know what report
we have to write.

00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:33.275
I shouldn't hear that
'I don't know' next time.

00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:34.458
It should be 'I know.'

00:19:34.538 --> 00:19:37.925
Sir, we have tightened the security
in Airport and Railway stations.

00:19:38.005 --> 00:19:39.018
There is no chance of missing.

00:19:39.098 --> 00:19:41.746
Is he a street rowdy
like him to get him that easy?

00:19:42.226 --> 00:19:43.692
That Deva is a cold blooded criminal.

00:19:43.772 --> 00:19:45.109
He is very smart.

00:19:45.189 --> 00:19:46.388
Anyways, he is coming.
Let's see.

00:19:46.526 --> 00:19:47.578
Come on, let's go.

00:19:54.022 --> 00:19:54.965
Green tea?

00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:56.688
Order for brandy or rum also.

00:19:56.816 --> 00:19:58.189
You want stuff also along with that?

00:19:58.269 --> 00:19:59.172
I'm a psychiatrist.

00:19:59.252 --> 00:20:01.031
We both are doctors
in this hospital Mr Das.

00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:02.540
I had a temple feeling when
I came here at the first blush.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.985
But, now I have a feeling
of watchman at mortuary.

00:20:04.065 --> 00:20:05.503
I cherish the poems
of my grandfather's

00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:06.863
at my childhood when
I sit in the mortuary.

00:20:06.943 --> 00:20:09.353
Interesting. - Have a duty at
mortuary if you have such interest.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.133
Doctor Kuchipudi.

00:20:11.213 --> 00:20:12.745
Please come Mr Murty.
You want green tea?

00:20:12.825 --> 00:20:14.328
My wife along with his
brother wants to go airport.

00:20:14.408 --> 00:20:15.711
She says her brother will
be upset if he goes in the cab.

00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:16.924
Otherwise,
she wants to give divorce me.

00:20:17.004 --> 00:20:18.507
That's a golden opportunity, grab it.

00:20:18.666 --> 00:20:21.013
Can you take care ICU night duty?

00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:22.622
ICU?

00:20:22.702 --> 00:20:24.037
I have a risk of losing my job.

00:20:24.117 --> 00:20:25.648
I'll stay in the ICU sir.

00:20:25.846 --> 00:20:27.000
Are you sure sir?
- I'm sure.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.584
Then, come to ICU in the morning sir.

00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:29.622
I'll be there at 5:30 in the morning.

00:20:29.702 --> 00:20:31.267
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

00:20:31.804 --> 00:20:33.657
See, Mr Das. Is not how...

00:20:37.554 --> 00:20:38.863
Oh no!

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:40.206
Green tea.

00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:56.102
Hello sir.

00:20:57.095 --> 00:20:58.987
what is that expression
like a bridegroom

00:20:59.067 --> 00:21:00.347
came into the first night room.

00:21:01.855 --> 00:21:03.482
This is ICU sir. Patient...

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.367
They are alive dear.

00:21:13.354 --> 00:21:14.438
Hello Doctor!
- Hello!

00:21:14.518 --> 00:21:16.177
Are you Mr Das?
- Yes.

00:21:16.536 --> 00:21:18.042
Mr Murthy told about you.

00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:20.077
Stop madadm.
Visiting hours are over.

00:21:20.157 --> 00:21:21.488
You cannot go inside.
- Security.

00:21:23.592 --> 00:21:24.517
You can go.

00:21:30.992 --> 00:21:34.212
Hello. As soon as I finished my
duty I'll come to the metro station.

00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:35.360
You come there.

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:53.718
Doctor, Doctor.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.067
What problem with the patient?

00:21:59.147 --> 00:22:00.789
Severe pain sir.
- Surgery has done to him.

00:22:00.935 --> 00:22:02.047
We kept him in observation.

00:22:02.127 --> 00:22:04.222
Give him oxygen immediately
and give 2mg clorosicbam.

00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:07.106
Check the BP and only
for normal seven balls.

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:08.503
Where are the reports?

00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:13.819
What? Why are you following
this prescription after operation?

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.312
Mr Bhardwaj told sir.

00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:17.039
Mr Murthy also following this only.

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.415
After surgery we
have to give low dosage.

00:22:20.495 --> 00:22:22.557
Because this is high dosage,
the basic complications are coming.

00:22:23.028 --> 00:22:25.180
Go and bring this injections
and medicine immediately.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.263
Do it fast.

00:22:26.343 --> 00:22:28.535
Sir, we need
Mr Bhardwaj's permission

00:22:28.615 --> 00:22:30.300
to change the prescription.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.532
I'm duty doctor here.

00:22:31.612 --> 00:22:33.076
It is my responsibility if
something happened to the patient.

00:22:33.156 --> 00:22:34.161
Go and do it, quick.

00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:38.390
It's okay, it's okay.

00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:39.961
What happened sister?

00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:41.480
All of a sudden he
has a breathing problem.

00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:46.187
Sir, let's inform to Mr Bhardwagj.
- Get ready the blood immediately.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.257
Sir, the BP is getting down.

00:22:58.647 --> 00:22:59.982
Bleeding is diminishing.

00:23:47.282 --> 00:23:48.683
Are you frightened?
- Yes.

00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:51.246
Because you put the sindhura,
his disease completely suppressed.

00:23:51.788 --> 00:23:53.737
His out of danger.
- Thank you doctor.

00:23:56.936 --> 00:24:00.567
Such a single minute is enough
for a doctor to get delighted.

00:24:01.121 --> 00:24:03.273
'After the God'

00:24:03.353 --> 00:24:06.558
'the doctor only has the power
to provide life on the earth.'

00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:01.708
Hail to Lord Ganesha!

00:25:02.302 --> 00:25:06.421
Hail to Lord Ganesha!

00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:05.786
Deva.

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:24.177
What the hell do
you think of yourself?

00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:27.401
How dare you change
my patient's medication?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.800
Mr Murthy,
anything happened to the patient?

00:29:28.916 --> 00:29:30.040
No sir, he is in a good condition.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.617
Shut up Murthy, just shut up.

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.365
And you Mr Das!
- Sir.

00:29:34.592 --> 00:29:37.016
You think you reached to a
position that change the prescription

00:29:37.096 --> 00:29:38.585
of a senior doctor within
four days of your joining?

00:29:38.665 --> 00:29:40.315
I didn't remember the range
and position at that time sir.

00:29:40.459 --> 00:29:42.026
When the patient's
situation is critical...

00:29:42.106 --> 00:29:43.099
Shut up!

00:29:44.207 --> 00:29:47.688
You know what they write on the
dismissal papers for this behavior?

00:29:47.768 --> 00:29:50.699
They write Bad conduct and
very harmful for the patient's care.

00:29:50.779 --> 00:29:52.385
Now only,
I report to the medical counsel.

00:29:52.465 --> 00:29:55.955
Sir, my career will be spoiled.

00:29:56.515 --> 00:29:58.225
Just shut up and get lost.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.413
Give me one chance sir.

00:29:59.493 --> 00:30:02.358
I'll make your medical license
be seized if you don't go out.

00:30:48.218 --> 00:30:50.383
Are you worrying?

00:30:50.463 --> 00:30:51.822
We are panic.

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:54.106
Are you panic?

00:30:55.693 --> 00:30:56.983
It is drizzling only.

00:31:04.605 --> 00:31:07.317
Don't you know business
people should not be fear?

00:31:09.249 --> 00:31:12.525
That Seth only the
powerful person than us.

00:31:12.605 --> 00:31:14.655
He killed him among the security
with five hundred persons.

00:31:14.896 --> 00:31:17.088
If he knows we all are together...

00:31:17.664 --> 00:31:18.760
So, let's kill him.

00:31:19.928 --> 00:31:20.808
Yes.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:23.448
let's kill him.

00:31:36.591 --> 00:31:37.698
Where is Deva?

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.533
Thank you Jimmy.
- Welcome sir.

00:31:41.876 --> 00:31:43.957
Why you killed Narayana
Seth as soon as you come?

00:31:44.914 --> 00:31:46.156
Why you came with
empty hands this time

00:31:46.236 --> 00:31:47.321
since you come with sweet box always?

00:31:47.401 --> 00:31:50.456
Sweet box? I thought you
will be in a grief of Dada's death.

00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:52.995
Grief will be expressed
in different ways by people.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.313
Your expression is you
came without a sweet box.

00:31:55.393 --> 00:31:58.121
My expression of grief is I killed
Narayana seth as soon as I come.

00:31:58.201 --> 00:32:00.315
I thought you visit
him for your last sight.

00:32:00.395 --> 00:32:02.149
I'm not his born and brought up son.

00:32:02.558 --> 00:32:05.401
I'm invisible son.
That's why I didn't come.

00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:09.301
By the way, where is Ajay?
Have you met him lately?

00:32:09.381 --> 00:32:10.753
He always roam around the pubs and he

00:32:10.833 --> 00:32:11.964
might have fell down
after boozing with the girls.

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:13.553
I think, it is his expression.

00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:18.134
Not good.

00:32:20.181 --> 00:32:22.174
Where do I get a good fish fry?

00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:24.582
Fish?
- Ask Ajay to come there.

00:32:25.655 --> 00:32:27.216
Don't tell him that I'm coming.

00:32:36.178 --> 00:32:37.851
What is this?
- Hospital.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.147
If it that much it
is called as hospital

00:32:40.227 --> 00:32:41.643
and if it is this much
it is called as clinic.

00:32:43.175 --> 00:32:45.334
It is important to
you to get a job somewhere.

00:32:45.461 --> 00:32:47.504
Otherwise,
it seems, you will become mad.

00:33:02.888 --> 00:33:04.332
For a trouser I charge rupees 200,
for shirt is 400

00:33:04.412 --> 00:33:05.524
and for saree and blouse is 500

00:33:05.604 --> 00:33:08.419
Two hundred extra for
alteration of trouser.

00:33:08.499 --> 00:33:10.453
Mr Mohan is this you?

00:33:10.533 --> 00:33:12.427
Henceforth, good days
are coming to your medical shop

00:33:12.507 --> 00:33:14.071
that a new doctor
is coming to this place.

00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:16.527
Do you know who is that doctor?
- Who knows that?

00:33:16.607 --> 00:33:19.690
He is coming means,
half of his life has gone.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:24.400
Why he is hurt like he is the doctor?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.718
He only that doctor.

00:33:27.148 --> 00:33:28.086
Sir.

00:33:29.637 --> 00:33:31.341
Sorry sir.
My name is Jacky...

00:33:31.421 --> 00:33:33.781
Jackichan, compounder cum tailor.

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:34.913
There is not even a bouquet
available at this time.

00:33:34.993 --> 00:33:36.188
Sir, welcome to the hospital.

00:33:36.268 --> 00:33:37.338
There is no blanket to greet you.

00:33:37.418 --> 00:33:39.600
I have a blouse which is
stitched fresh. Adjust with this.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.149
What is this doing tailoring here?
- What is the difference in both?

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.856
Compounder has to
provide pins and medicine

00:33:43.936 --> 00:33:45.752
and the tailor has to
get the thread into the pin.

00:33:45.832 --> 00:33:47.656
What a bad comparison?

00:33:49.168 --> 00:33:51.918
Something is burning inside.
- No sir, smoking.

00:33:52.653 --> 00:33:53.799
Means...
- Cigarette.

00:33:54.014 --> 00:33:56.233
Don't go that way sir.
Please sir.

00:33:56.313 --> 00:33:57.686
Why are you shaky?
- I'm not shaky sir.

00:33:57.766 --> 00:34:01.270
What is happening in the room?
- Sir, sir, please don't go.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.726
Listen to me sir, don't go.
They are not an ordinary people sir.

00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:05.604
They are useless
fellows in this area.

00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:08.006
You! Move aside.

00:34:09.271 --> 00:34:12.180
What you blouse fellow... who are you?

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.763
Is he your relative?
- What is this?

00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:15.527
This is a Kerala Cheap liquor.

00:34:15.607 --> 00:34:19.561
It has 62% alcohol and
18% GST with credit card payment.

00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:23.013
Hello, you shouldn't smoke inside,
get out. What he is saying?

00:34:23.093 --> 00:34:25.028
He is saying don't smoke
and asking us to go outside.

00:34:25.108 --> 00:34:27.867
You say to get out
to this Dhulpet Durga?

00:34:28.017 --> 00:34:29.329
Excuse me, I'm doctor.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:30.779
Doctor Das MBBS,
MS with gold medalist.

00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:34.895
This is not your hospital,
this is Durga's residence.

00:34:35.335 --> 00:34:40.446
If you talk too much, I'll
remove your legs and cut your nerves.

00:34:40.526 --> 00:34:42.483
Have you understood?
Let's go.

00:34:46.844 --> 00:34:49.955
Why should be disturb them?

00:34:50.093 --> 00:34:51.531
Our work is ours and
their work is theirs.

00:34:51.611 --> 00:34:53.236
We have our medical
shop in that side.

00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:56.156
We have our machine also this side.

00:35:03.716 --> 00:35:06.462
Rajan, this is the place
of best fish fry in Hyderbad.

00:35:06.542 --> 00:35:07.542
Come on.

00:35:10.524 --> 00:35:13.763
Lakshmi,
I want a nice Masala fish fry.

00:35:13.843 --> 00:35:16.232
I don't have enough Masala fish fry.
I have normal fish fry only.

00:35:16.312 --> 00:35:18.869
Have you not recognized me?

00:35:18.949 --> 00:35:21.782
Are you a Amitab Bachan
to recognize as soon as I saw you.

00:35:21.862 --> 00:35:24.175
I'll send the fry.
Go and sit there.

00:35:43.168 --> 00:35:44.995
Rajan, the city has
been changed a lot.

00:35:45.189 --> 00:35:47.110
It will be like that only
when you come after ten years.

00:35:49.431 --> 00:35:50.288
Ajay came.

00:35:59.601 --> 00:36:01.807
Didn't you get any
place for our meeting?

00:36:01.887 --> 00:36:03.445
No one gets any doubt
if it is here only.

00:36:06.673 --> 00:36:08.721
Sir, Ajay met someone now.

00:36:08.801 --> 00:36:10.505
Keep watching and inform me.

00:36:11.301 --> 00:36:12.187
Who killed?

00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:13.400
Why are you asking me?

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.265
Did I know before
that they will kill?

00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:17.244
That means,
are you there only when Dada killed?

00:36:17.324 --> 00:36:19.202
Not only me, the entire
syndicate was present then.

00:36:20.226 --> 00:36:22.371
What is syndicate?
- Don't you know what is happening?

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.575
All are united by
forming a syndicate.

00:36:24.655 --> 00:36:25.992
I cannot say anything now.

00:36:26.168 --> 00:36:27.381
I have to talk an
important thing with you.

00:36:27.461 --> 00:36:29.250
What I'm talking and
what are you talking?

00:36:32.415 --> 00:36:34.802
What you want to talk? - I came
to know that Deva came into the city.

00:36:34.882 --> 00:36:36.728
Then what?
- I want your help.

00:36:36.859 --> 00:36:38.768
For what?
- Let's kill the Deva.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.526
Are you able to understand
what are you talking?

00:36:44.606 --> 00:36:45.977
What is that killing Deva?

00:36:48.819 --> 00:36:49.940
What?

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.132
I want water.
- What are you talking?

00:36:54.106 --> 00:36:57.148
Lakshmi, a nice Masala fish fry.

00:36:57.854 --> 00:36:59.484
You think I forgotten you?

00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:02.409
It has been lot of years
now hearing your voice.

00:37:02.489 --> 00:37:04.211
That's why only I couldn't recognize.

00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:05.738
You are Deva, isn't it?

00:37:13.216 --> 00:37:14.528
Sir, Deva is here only.

00:37:14.608 --> 00:37:15.536
What?

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.703
Deva? I am coming.

00:37:17.783 --> 00:37:18.988
Come on, let's go, quick.

00:37:20.435 --> 00:37:23.057
How are you?
- I'm fine.

00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:28.244
What are the plans you have?

00:37:29.744 --> 00:37:31.550
Deva, police.

00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:38.669
Deva.

00:37:42.248 --> 00:37:44.981
I'll kill her.

00:37:46.894 --> 00:37:47.951
Deva.

00:37:56.584 --> 00:37:59.817
Deva! Deva! Police.
- You move on.

00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:15.463
There he is, fire.

00:38:18.816 --> 00:38:21.226
Come on boys, move, move. Fast!

00:38:21.306 --> 00:38:22.323
Go, go, go.
- Yes, sir.

00:39:05.004 --> 00:39:06.466
Who is the doctor here?

00:39:06.546 --> 00:39:08.046
Me only, I'm the doctor.

00:39:08.126 --> 00:39:09.566
Why are you looking? Come.

00:39:11.608 --> 00:39:13.163
Blood! Jocky.

00:39:13.937 --> 00:39:15.457
Okay, sir. Okay...

00:39:16.983 --> 00:39:20.964
What is this sir? Who fired like this?

00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:24.617
Don't worry sir,
I'll take care of everything.

00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:26.870
There is a police station
in vicinity. I'll inform them.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.266
No police.

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:33.570
Okay.

00:39:37.896 --> 00:39:39.158
What is that?

00:39:39.238 --> 00:39:40.745
Anesthesia. Everything will
be okay if I give this to you.

00:39:40.825 --> 00:39:42.527
No anesthesia, remove the bullets.

00:39:42.607 --> 00:39:45.133
You'll get lot of pain.
After giving anesthesia, later...

00:39:45.213 --> 00:39:46.632
Will you inform to the police?

00:39:47.633 --> 00:39:49.973
I don't inform to the promise,
promise.

00:39:50.053 --> 00:39:52.123
Oh! I promised.

00:39:52.203 --> 00:39:53.472
Remove the bullets.

00:39:53.552 --> 00:39:56.143
You don't want?

00:40:01.546 --> 00:40:03.103
Approximately over.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.054
All the equipment here is
are in bending. Let's do one thing.

00:40:07.134 --> 00:40:08.443
There is a big hospital in vicinity.
Let's go to there.

00:40:08.523 --> 00:40:10.450
Hey, are you a doctor really?

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.731
MBBS! MS, Gold medalist.

00:40:12.716 --> 00:40:13.556
Remove it from your hand.

00:40:13.636 --> 00:40:14.772
Is it a thorn to
remove with the hand?

00:40:15.322 --> 00:40:16.614
It came.

00:40:30.366 --> 00:40:31.371
It's okay...

00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:33.664
Give me two minutes. It will
take two minutes for stitching.

00:40:37.838 --> 00:40:39.271
Are there anyone of your followers?

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.360
See, who came? Go and check. Go.

00:40:42.512 --> 00:40:45.389
Okay, put the pressure.

00:40:52.926 --> 00:40:54.378
How much time you will take, sir?
- You?

00:40:54.558 --> 00:40:56.996
Who you thought?
- It seems, it will rain.

00:40:57.377 --> 00:40:58.465
Come, let's go. I don't come.
I have a little work here.

00:40:58.545 --> 00:41:00.135
What's the work you have here?
Let's go.

00:41:00.215 --> 00:41:01.874
What are you hiding?
- It's personal.

00:41:02.516 --> 00:41:04.077
What sir, what happened?
- Why should I tell you.

00:41:04.157 --> 00:41:05.199
See, the power also gone. Let's go.

00:41:05.279 --> 00:41:07.782
You go.
- Sir! Sir!

00:41:15.592 --> 00:41:17.423
It took some time
to bring the candle.

00:41:17.503 --> 00:41:19.821
I have to lay stitches
immediately if you lay down.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.941
Already the blood has bled a lot.

00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.771
It will be danger if any delay.

00:42:17.651 --> 00:42:19.124
Didn't you call the police?

00:42:24.096 --> 00:42:25.760
It is there.

00:42:33.688 --> 00:42:38.391
Four days rest is needed
along with the antibiotic high dose.

00:42:47.299 --> 00:42:49.551
'Why did he come?'

00:42:50.296 --> 00:42:52.366
'After the bullets
in the body also...'

00:42:53.202 --> 00:42:54.340
Vikram!
- Sir.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.524
Check out all the
hospitals which are

00:42:56.604 --> 00:42:58.148
within the five kilometers radius.
- Sir!

00:42:58.228 --> 00:43:00.544
I want the list of patients who were
admitted in the last fifteen hours.

00:43:00.624 --> 00:43:02.722
Do it now.
- Sure sir, I'll get it.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.407
Thanks, Michelle.
- You are welcome.

00:43:14.937 --> 00:43:18.443
David! Deva came
yesterday to see Ajay.

00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:20.204
Police shoot out happened.

00:43:20.284 --> 00:43:21.900
They chased him.

00:43:22.256 --> 00:43:24.695
Oh! They shoot him?
- Yes.

00:43:25.642 --> 00:43:26.948
He might have survived.

00:43:27.281 --> 00:43:28.407
Don't know.

00:43:32.715 --> 00:43:35.546
Deva! Deva! Deva!

00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:38.646
Run Deva...

00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:43.380
Deva! Deva!

00:43:46.057 --> 00:43:47.221
Where did you go last night?

00:43:48.928 --> 00:43:49.972
Tell Deva.

00:43:50.052 --> 00:43:51.362
I built it with difficulty.

00:43:52.458 --> 00:43:53.462
It has collapsed.

00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:55.667
I'm not talking
about the cards Deva.

00:43:55.747 --> 00:43:57.657
I'm talking about me.

00:43:58.628 --> 00:44:01.097
They formed the syndicate
without my knowledge.

00:44:01.177 --> 00:44:04.446
They made me to come
here by killing Dada.

00:44:04.746 --> 00:44:06.395
They shoot me with the bullet.

00:44:06.475 --> 00:44:08.126
This is happened because of Ajay.

00:44:08.206 --> 00:44:09.559
With a fear of killing Dada,
he joined hands with them.

00:44:09.639 --> 00:44:15.263
Hey! Rajan,
I want each one of the syndicate.

00:44:15.343 --> 00:44:16.829
I don't leave anyone.

00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:18.610
That Ajay...

00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:20.215
Deva, are you okay?

00:44:20.922 --> 00:44:24.123
Okay. I just want Ajay. Go.

00:44:32.321 --> 00:44:34.596
Sir, why did the gang
war took place in such place?

00:44:34.676 --> 00:44:35.915
For God's sake it's not a gang war,

00:44:35.995 --> 00:44:37.434
it's just a street fight.
Next, please.

00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:40.945
Dad, buy such a big
machine gun for me.

00:44:41.025 --> 00:44:44.265
Are you going to the school
or military training? Sit.

00:44:44.345 --> 00:44:45.657
Sir, there is a propaganda
that Deva came to the city

00:44:45.737 --> 00:44:47.012
and got injured in the shoot out.
What's your comment?

00:44:47.397 --> 00:44:48.479
Which channel?
- N Tv.

00:44:48.559 --> 00:44:49.541
N Tv.

00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:51.739
For information, it had ten
years now after Deva left the city

00:44:51.819 --> 00:44:53.420
Don't know whether
he is alive or not.

00:44:53.676 --> 00:44:55.175
Every matter is connect
with this Deva...

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:57.789
Since morning all the news channels
are killing us about this Deva only.

00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.226
That's what the breaking news means.

00:44:59.306 --> 00:45:01.406
He is a gang leader,
not a street rowdy.

00:45:01.486 --> 00:45:03.572
What the police are doing while
such violence has been taking place?

00:45:03.652 --> 00:45:04.589
We are flying the paper kites.

00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:07.281
Why you police are hiding the
truth that Deva came into the city?

00:45:07.361 --> 00:45:09.585
That's all for now, thank you.
- Sir...

00:45:11.524 --> 00:45:15.127
Uncle, could you buy
such a big machine gun for me?

00:45:15.207 --> 00:45:16.515
Keep quiet.

00:45:16.595 --> 00:45:18.376
Bullet...
- Promise.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.494
Bullet... where is it?
- Please, uncle...

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.719
Bullet
- Uncle.

00:45:22.799 --> 00:45:24.277
Das, where are you
going without the dinner?

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.827
Das, don't you understand
when we told you to shut your shop?

00:45:36.907 --> 00:45:39.063
Are you crazy?
- I'll go away.

00:45:39.143 --> 00:45:40.260
When bullet was
dropped on the floor...

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.661
No, I want to take the clothes.

00:45:41.741 --> 00:45:44.289
You don't understand
if we tell like this.

00:45:49.303 --> 00:45:50.918
If I press the trigger...

00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.680
Hey!
- Who are you?

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.034
I'm his patient.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.376
Patient? Are patients
are coming to your hospital?

00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:01.830
What is that in your hands?

00:46:01.974 --> 00:46:04.319
Gun. Don't you this also?

00:46:04.763 --> 00:46:05.874
What is the model of the gun?

00:46:05.954 --> 00:46:07.565
Is this a vehicle
to tell about the model?

00:46:07.645 --> 00:46:08.839
This is a gun.

00:46:08.919 --> 00:46:10.105
The breath will not go
away if you fire with that gun

00:46:10.185 --> 00:46:11.213
except at point block range.

00:46:11.293 --> 00:46:13.027
Are you making fun of me?

00:46:13.107 --> 00:46:15.963
Sir, sir. Let it be.

00:46:16.043 --> 00:46:19.342
Are you teaching me?

00:46:19.422 --> 00:46:20.850
I'll kill you biting your neck.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.289
Oh, God!

00:46:26.651 --> 00:46:27.873
Which model, sir?

00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:32.579
Point 9mm,
Russian make, 200 meters range.

00:46:35.882 --> 00:46:39.140
Mr Doctor, take care of the patient.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.933
It seems,
it is useful for the playing only.

00:46:44.233 --> 00:46:46.911
Why did they come?
- What can I say?

00:46:47.254 --> 00:46:50.235
Patients are not coming
to my hospital except criminals.

00:46:50.315 --> 00:46:51.914
Didn't the people know
that there is a clinic here?

00:46:51.994 --> 00:46:54.949
For my fate,
nobody knows except you.

00:46:57.042 --> 00:46:58.116
I'm getting pain.

00:47:02.258 --> 00:47:04.221
Expected,
the stitches were unleashed.

00:47:05.136 --> 00:47:06.117
You have soda?

00:47:06.197 --> 00:47:07.532
You shouldn't drink here.

00:47:07.612 --> 00:47:08.992
It is for anesthesia.

00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:14.140
What is your name?
- Das.

00:47:14.439 --> 00:47:15.941
Are you an RMP holder?

00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:18.460
MBBS, MS,
University topper, gold medalist.

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:22.430
We can get lot of gold medals
when you throw a gold biscuit.

00:47:22.868 --> 00:47:25.803
Gold medal meals not an ornament,
it is an achievement.

00:47:26.524 --> 00:47:28.522
It will not come if you want to buy.

00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:30.004
It will come by your dream.

00:47:30.769 --> 00:47:32.445
The feeling is different
when you dream.

00:47:32.525 --> 00:47:34.741
Same feeling.
- Do you also get dreams?

00:47:34.821 --> 00:47:37.203
Yes, it's done, you can go.

00:47:39.765 --> 00:47:45.639
Deva, in TV news the
police are searching for you.

00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:47.467
Why didn't you tell about me?

00:47:47.547 --> 00:47:51.220
That doctor shouldn't deceive

00:47:52.138 --> 00:47:53.574
once the patient trust the doctor.

00:47:58.933 --> 00:48:01.515
This is your bullet.

00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:04.583
You can take it.

00:48:06.458 --> 00:48:07.844
I'll come again.

00:48:10.393 --> 00:48:11.645
Again?

00:48:15.302 --> 00:48:16.563
What about this?

00:48:16.643 --> 00:48:18.315
Sister-in-law, you brought
me here though I denied to come.

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.630
My inside irritation is going high.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:21.885
Let's go soon sister-in-law.

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:23.155
What will you do going soon

00:48:23.235 --> 00:48:25.912
except watching the
cockroaches and insects?

00:48:25.992 --> 00:48:27.285
Any patient came?

00:48:27.365 --> 00:48:29.500
One patient came.
- He might have missed the way.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.696
He will not come again.

00:48:31.038 --> 00:48:32.090
Second time also...

00:48:33.442 --> 00:48:34.691
She came.

00:48:34.771 --> 00:48:38.260
Mom, I'm hungry.
- Das, take care him.

00:48:53.442 --> 00:48:54.731
Do you know this address?

00:48:55.004 --> 00:48:56.692
Don't know.
- We know.

00:48:59.342 --> 00:49:00.461
Who is this?

00:49:01.958 --> 00:49:03.362
Who is this sir?

00:49:03.442 --> 00:49:04.565
Hello.

00:49:07.432 --> 00:49:09.688
Who are you sir?
Why did you brought me here?

00:49:09.768 --> 00:49:11.075
I think you are confused.

00:49:11.155 --> 00:49:14.521
Doctor Das. Dhulpet clinic.

00:49:15.523 --> 00:49:18.319
A person came there with
a wound of bullet in the midnight.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.160
He is Deva.

00:49:23.845 --> 00:49:24.828
Who is Deva, sir?

00:49:24.908 --> 00:49:27.993
I'll give you a flat,
car and hundred millions.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.002
Do a work for me.

00:49:31.475 --> 00:49:32.506
Snake.

00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:37.785
Kill Deva taking this.
- No...

00:49:38.671 --> 00:49:39.805
You don't want this?

00:49:39.959 --> 00:49:42.092
Give him another gun.

00:49:42.172 --> 00:49:43.693
Hey, I don't want it.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.786
I never touch the gun in my life

00:49:45.866 --> 00:49:47.335
except touching the scissors,
band-aids and injections.

00:49:47.415 --> 00:49:50.175
Give him anesthetics and we will
take care of the remaining work.

00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:51.403
Why are you bargaining sir?

00:49:51.483 --> 00:49:53.064
We'll do one thing.

00:49:53.228 --> 00:49:55.603
I'll provide a free treatment
for you in your life for once.

00:49:58.537 --> 00:50:00.901
Do you think, I'm a patient?

00:50:01.496 --> 00:50:04.724
Tell, do you kill him or not?
- That...

00:50:04.804 --> 00:50:06.480
Do you kill him or not?
- Listen to me once, sir.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.511
Do you kill him or not?
- What a life of mine?

00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:10.092
Whomever I save,
everything comes unto my life.

00:50:10.172 --> 00:50:11.031
Kill me, sir.

00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:12.502
I cannot take away
the life which I saved.

00:50:12.582 --> 00:50:13.681
Kill me, sir.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.414
He is not accepting to kill
you though he has a fear of us.

00:50:34.882 --> 00:50:36.647
So sweet.

00:50:37.073 --> 00:50:41.141
Rajan, you said that we
have to kill him as he is strange.

00:50:41.221 --> 00:50:43.871
Sir! One minute, sir.
What is happening here sir?

00:50:43.951 --> 00:50:45.029
There is a small
test for your honesty.

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:46.111
Test?
- You passed it with first class.

00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:49.011
He is already topper
and gold medalist.

00:50:49.714 --> 00:50:51.580
Are you gold medalist?

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:53.074
Don't grab my cheeks like that.

00:50:53.154 --> 00:50:54.437
This is not correct
to bring me here.

00:50:54.517 --> 00:50:56.319
It is wrong, sir.
- You said you don't have patients.

00:50:56.399 --> 00:50:57.445
What is the relation
between that and this?

00:51:01.712 --> 00:51:03.267
Let's make him a doctor.

00:51:03.347 --> 00:51:04.555
We can make him
without any hesitation.

00:51:04.635 --> 00:51:05.700
What you make me a doctor?

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.461
I'm already a doctor,
MBBS, MS, Gold medalist.

00:51:10.629 --> 00:51:13.635
Gold, from today
onwards you are M.D.

00:51:14.626 --> 00:51:18.368
Sir, I'm not interested in M.D.

00:51:18.448 --> 00:51:23.398
Sir...
- M.D means Doctor for Mafia.

00:51:23.478 --> 00:51:24.883
Is that? I thought something else...

00:51:24.963 --> 00:51:26.312
Mafia? Doc...
- Yes.

00:51:26.392 --> 00:51:29.475
That means,
for all of you, I... Sir.

00:51:30.175 --> 00:51:31.487
Look for someone else.

00:51:31.567 --> 00:51:33.668
For you murderers, I cannot...

00:51:36.041 --> 00:51:36.939
Welcome.

00:52:09.261 --> 00:52:10.654
Who are you all?

00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:16.779
What is happening, sir?
- How can I know?

00:52:16.859 --> 00:52:18.345
My machine.

00:52:22.947 --> 00:52:24.021
SANTHABHAI MEMORIAL CHARITY HOSPITAL

00:52:41.136 --> 00:52:42.429
Hey, Gold!

00:52:43.047 --> 00:52:45.364
Nice. Cheers.

00:52:51.488 --> 00:52:53.998
My hand is broken. The doctor
stitched it cutting my hand.

00:52:54.078 --> 00:52:54.934
Though it was not suppressed.

00:52:55.014 --> 00:52:56.548
I went to the hospital
and stabbed the doctor.

00:52:56.628 --> 00:52:57.712
Is it wrong?

00:52:57.792 --> 00:52:59.319
Wait. Wait.

00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.507
Who killed Dada?
- Don't know.

00:53:06.587 --> 00:53:07.691
You don't know?
- Don't know.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.324
You know your problem?
- No.

00:53:15.404 --> 00:53:16.714
You don't know how to live.

00:53:25.282 --> 00:53:26.794
Yes!

00:53:31.973 --> 00:53:33.602
It's not good to booze here.

00:53:34.289 --> 00:53:36.724
I don't come again if
you take this gun from my hand.

00:53:38.908 --> 00:53:41.397
It is in your pocket.
- How it will be in my pocket?

00:53:44.656 --> 00:53:47.148
Excuse me,
is anyone namely Deva came to you?

00:53:47.228 --> 00:53:48.580
Who I Deva?

00:53:50.506 --> 00:53:52.328
We didn't get any
information here, sir.

00:53:52.593 --> 00:53:54.579
Have a spy on the
surrounding hospitals.

00:53:54.892 --> 00:53:56.196
Okay, sir.
- Let's go.

00:53:57.992 --> 00:53:59.413
The police are also
started coming here.

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:01.148
I lied with them.

00:54:01.454 --> 00:54:03.226
My situation is becoming
worse gradually.

00:54:03.637 --> 00:54:04.457
The police and criminals
are surrounded me

00:54:04.537 --> 00:54:05.609
since I woke up in the morning.

00:54:05.689 --> 00:54:08.344
I'm forgetting that I'm a doctor.

00:54:08.876 --> 00:54:09.961
Hey, Gold!

00:54:10.454 --> 00:54:12.370
No one has to come here,
is that you want?

00:54:13.963 --> 00:54:15.069
No one will come.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.389
It seems, it is an emergency case.

00:54:22.564 --> 00:54:24.447
You said our people shouldn't
come to the hospital?

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:25.759
So what?

00:54:45.647 --> 00:54:47.676
Increased number
of murders in the city.

00:54:47.756 --> 00:54:49.482
How can he is murdering
people such cruelly?

00:54:49.562 --> 00:54:51.513
Doesn't he has any humanity?

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:13.027
Move, move. Where did you go?

00:55:13.856 --> 00:55:15.096
Move.

00:55:30.522 --> 00:55:31.705
Stop it.

00:55:33.357 --> 00:55:34.247
Tell now.

00:55:34.327 --> 00:55:37.443
The God will shower his
immense blessing unto you.

00:56:20.952 --> 00:56:21.947
Sir...

00:56:22.282 --> 00:56:24.306
Sir! Please sir...
- Leave it.

00:56:24.386 --> 00:56:25.634
Sir, what will be my situation

00:56:25.714 --> 00:56:26.793
if you leave this
place at this juncture?

00:56:26.873 --> 00:56:27.802
With a courage of your presence here

00:56:27.882 --> 00:56:29.226
I have sold out my
tailoring machine also.

00:56:29.306 --> 00:56:30.333
Tailor became a compounder.

00:56:30.413 --> 00:56:31.686
Bring some driver
and make him as a doctor.

00:56:31.766 --> 00:56:33.428
Patients are waiting outside sir.

00:56:33.508 --> 00:56:35.035
Tell them I'm not here.
Tell them that I'm died.

00:56:35.115 --> 00:56:36.847
What I have to tell them
when they ask how you died?

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:46.982
Send that girl inside.
I mean, send that patient inside.

00:56:47.062 --> 00:56:48.026
You asked me to tell
that you are died?

00:56:48.106 --> 00:56:50.108
You sold out the machine.
- Okay, sir.

00:56:56.016 --> 00:56:59.385
Hello madam,
doctor called you inside.

00:57:00.472 --> 00:57:01.631
Come, madam.
- Okay.

00:57:06.604 --> 00:57:07.564
Doctor!

00:57:09.175 --> 00:57:12.812
Doctor Das, MBBS, MS, gold medalist.

00:57:12.892 --> 00:57:14.254
My name is Pooja.

00:57:15.076 --> 00:57:16.652
Pooja?

00:57:18.652 --> 00:57:20.845
Pooja...
- What the problem is...

00:57:20.925 --> 00:57:22.949
What is problem in it? I like it.

00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:25.372
Not that sir.
- Call me Das. Das is okay for me.

00:57:25.452 --> 00:57:27.402
Don't you call me?

00:57:27.482 --> 00:57:28.366
Who are you and why
did you come inside?

00:57:28.446 --> 00:57:29.888
Jocky.
- Hey, let's go.

00:57:29.968 --> 00:57:31.495
He is my grandfather.
The problem is related to him only.

00:57:31.945 --> 00:57:33.930
Problem is withb him?
- Jocky don't you see him?

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.110
Grandpa, you come, sit here.

00:57:38.404 --> 00:57:39.611
You also sit.
- Thank you.

00:57:39.855 --> 00:57:40.939
Get out Jocky.
- I don't go.

00:57:41.019 --> 00:57:42.298
Then, stay here.

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:44.357
Tell me, what is the problem?

00:57:44.437 --> 00:57:45.828
Water is not coming
in the bathroom, sir.

00:57:50.528 --> 00:57:51.499
You tell me, sir.

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:54.927
I have Asthma, High BP, TB,

00:57:55.007 --> 00:57:58.286
Sugar, Gastritis, Cancer.

00:57:58.366 --> 00:58:00.228
Still you have breath?

00:58:00.686 --> 00:58:02.010
It seems, the polio also come to me.

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:03.733
Why polio at this last age?

00:58:03.924 --> 00:58:07.275
That's why only I told to you
that all the doctors are useless.

00:58:08.009 --> 00:58:09.833
Sorry.
- No one is believing me

00:58:09.913 --> 00:58:11.228
that I have all the diseases.

00:58:11.414 --> 00:58:13.272
You brought me here saying
that it is a great clinic.

00:58:13.352 --> 00:58:15.593
Let's go.
- Grandpa...

00:58:15.673 --> 00:58:17.799
I believe that you
have all the diseases.

00:58:17.879 --> 00:58:18.962
But, I don't believe.
- Shut your mouth.

00:58:19.042 --> 00:58:20.256
I don't shut my mouth.
I'll come back

00:58:20.336 --> 00:58:21.535
after informing to
the mortuary people.

00:58:22.978 --> 00:58:24.259
Sir, what we have to do now?

00:58:24.339 --> 00:58:26.448
Don't worry.
I'll take care of your grandfather.

00:58:26.528 --> 00:58:29.217
Keep on bringing your grandfather
to the clinic until one month.

00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:30.476
Both of us will get connected.

00:58:30.556 --> 00:58:32.678
Who are the two?
- Whoever they may be.

00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:36.128
Let's go.

00:58:36.208 --> 00:58:37.670
Okay. Thank you, sir.

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.667
Bye.

00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:57.950
You want soda or water?

00:59:00.378 --> 00:59:02.187
Whatever it may be.

00:59:06.194 --> 00:59:07.929
Hey, soda or water?

00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:14.621
Dasu, what is the matter?

00:59:15.429 --> 00:59:16.563
That is...

00:59:16.768 --> 00:59:18.561
Today I'm happy and in happiness...

00:59:18.777 --> 00:59:22.349
I don't know how to tell...

00:59:23.505 --> 00:59:25.884
Why don't you tell
to me about that happiness?

00:59:27.373 --> 00:59:29.380
That is raw.

00:59:30.302 --> 00:59:31.891
What is the mistake
in drinking the raw

00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:34.420
since you have taken the anesthesia?

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.522
I'll drink the raw only.

00:59:35.602 --> 00:59:37.502
What?
- Yes, it is raw only.

00:59:37.582 --> 00:59:39.100
No.
- Yes, it is raw only.

00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:44.911
Like you...
- Today I only will talk.

00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:47.576
Okay, go on.
- Only Dasu will speak.

00:59:50.819 --> 00:59:52.386
Okay, speak.

00:59:54.201 --> 00:59:57.182
Today is a very beautiful
day in my life Deva.

00:59:58.293 --> 00:59:59.917
You know what is love means?

00:59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.670
Is it love?
- It's love.

01:00:03.412 --> 01:00:06.486
How can you know about love?

01:00:10.969 --> 01:00:12.643
What is the length of the gun

01:00:12.723 --> 01:00:13.904
and how many bullets
will be there in the gun?

01:00:13.984 --> 01:00:15.922
You always have the same thinking.

01:00:17.338 --> 01:00:19.408
Love is magic Deva.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.089
Are you teaching
the love to the cupid?

01:00:22.169 --> 01:00:24.816
Are you a cupid?
You have such angle also?

01:00:24.896 --> 01:00:27.087
Once upon a time,
I too used to be in love.

01:00:27.167 --> 01:00:29.715
Are you be in alcohol now?
Hallucination.

01:00:29.795 --> 01:00:32.421
Hey, can you show your lover now?
- No.

01:00:32.501 --> 01:00:33.893
I can show.
- How?

01:00:33.973 --> 01:00:35.166
Switch on the TV.
- What?

01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:37.767
Bulletin time, tv 99.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.695
Come on Ravi, get ready, fast.
- Yes, sir. Get ready.

01:00:44.737 --> 01:00:47.164
Greetings,

01:00:50.861 --> 01:00:52.108
Deepika Padukone?

01:00:52.188 --> 01:00:53.364
Not the girl who is in the news,

01:00:53.444 --> 01:00:54.877
it is the girl who
is reading the news.

01:00:54.957 --> 01:00:57.428
Like this everyone
following the diet...

01:00:57.508 --> 01:00:59.176
This girl has been reading
the news from my childhood.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:00.937
Hey!
- I mean for the last five years.

01:01:01.017 --> 01:01:02.421
Tv 99.

01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:04.951
Your Jahnavi, signing off.
- She says she is Jahnavi.

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.946
She is not Janavi, she is Jahnavi.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.961
Have you loved Jahnavi truly, tell?

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:14.012
How did you meet her and love her?

01:01:14.617 --> 01:01:16.465
While I'm studying
in the college days...

01:01:16.545 --> 01:01:17.757
Is it black and white?

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:58.814
Didn't you see her again?

01:02:00.199 --> 01:02:02.647
A rain has fallen.

01:02:07.175 --> 01:02:08.276
Deva.

01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:44.364
Everyone's costumes
have been changed

01:03:44.444 --> 01:03:45.371
but why my costumes didn't change?

01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:46.781
You didn't connect yet.

01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:48.309
How it will be connected this early?

01:03:50.053 --> 01:03:51.709
Then, let's go.

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:08.838
Gold, you also connected.
- What is that?

01:05:08.918 --> 01:05:10.282
Costume change.

01:05:11.436 --> 01:05:12.396
That means, from henceforth?

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:13.859
Yes.
- Is it?

01:06:04.588 --> 01:06:08.004
Boys and girls go
back to your positions.

01:06:11.508 --> 01:06:13.380
Gold.

01:06:37.438 --> 01:06:40.902
Nobody is watching, sit down.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:44.578
It has finished.

01:06:45.733 --> 01:06:47.161
What happened thereafter?

01:06:47.588 --> 01:06:50.358
What will happen thereafter?
She became to know about me.

01:06:50.753 --> 01:06:52.217
Break up.

01:06:52.422 --> 01:06:53.307
Yes.

01:06:59.795 --> 01:07:00.861
Coffee.

01:07:01.177 --> 01:07:02.729
Why two coffees are needed for me?

01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:04.522
You brought someone last night.

01:07:06.107 --> 01:07:10.293
Who is he?
- Deva... Doctor Devashis Mohanati.

01:07:10.373 --> 01:07:11.807
Oh!
- He is my friend.

01:07:11.887 --> 01:07:14.636
Hey, it seems you
drunk a lot last night?

01:07:14.716 --> 01:07:17.179
He is telling that
I drunk lot of teas.

01:07:17.259 --> 01:07:19.740
Have you changed the
colors again to the clinic?

01:07:20.923 --> 01:07:25.200
Devashis Mohanati, this is
my home and she is my sister-in-law.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.820
What is happening here?

01:07:27.196 --> 01:07:29.438
Alcohol causes to side affects.
I'll set it right.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.887
Kalavathi, where is the new clothes?

01:07:31.967 --> 01:07:33.254
Take the coffee first.

01:07:33.506 --> 01:07:34.778
Who is he?

01:07:34.858 --> 01:07:36.591
He is the friend
of Das namely Devashis.

01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.422
You stay alone in the clinic.

01:07:39.113 --> 01:07:40.523
He is the friend while
I was working in the medimax.

01:07:40.603 --> 01:07:42.119
In medimax?
- Yes.

01:07:42.199 --> 01:07:44.120
Nice meeting with
you Doctor Devashis.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.191
Yes. Any speciality?

01:07:48.271 --> 01:07:50.130
Kindly understand the situation
of mine which I cannot convey you.

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.475
You have to convey it
when it is not conveyable.

01:07:51.555 --> 01:07:52.609
Sexologist.

01:07:52.891 --> 01:07:53.810
What it means?

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:55.839
Sex doctor.

01:07:55.919 --> 01:07:57.217
Oh!

01:07:58.267 --> 01:08:01.438
But, I didn't see you in
a TV show after eleven thirty.

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:03.421
He stays continuously
in the news throughout the day.

01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:05.231
Devashis,
we have to go to clinic urgently.

01:08:05.311 --> 01:08:06.246
Why going?

01:08:06.326 --> 01:08:07.547
We both have to talk each other.
- What are you going to talk?

01:08:07.627 --> 01:08:08.927
We elders will talk about something.

01:08:09.007 --> 01:08:11.185
You are a little one
and you'll be spoiled. Go to clinic.

01:08:12.748 --> 01:08:14.914
I'll come back after sending
him and you just wait here.

01:08:16.187 --> 01:08:17.742
Within two minutes I'll
come back after taking a bath.

01:08:17.822 --> 01:08:20.422
You only have to manage.
- Okay, I'll manage.

01:08:22.617 --> 01:08:24.721
You go. Go. Come on.

01:08:26.821 --> 01:08:28.550
Come, have a seat.

01:08:29.554 --> 01:08:30.574
Have a seat.

01:08:30.887 --> 01:08:32.752
I'll give you coffee afresh.

01:08:33.637 --> 01:08:36.908
Seven years before
this boy got birth.

01:08:37.185 --> 01:08:38.641
Very healthy boy.

01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:42.026
I didn't think about
children after three years.

01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:45.596
It is not going to workout

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:48.320
though I try a lot.

01:08:51.025 --> 01:08:52.398
Use the tablets.

01:08:52.478 --> 01:08:54.734
I know that you will
prefer this only as an expert.

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:56.422
What can we do apart from that?

01:08:57.806 --> 01:08:59.684
Yoga.
- That means, exercise.

01:08:59.764 --> 01:09:01.421
Which type of exercises?
- Savasana...

01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:03.143
Savasana.
- Suvasana.

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:04.817
Suvasana.
- Kamalasana.

01:09:04.897 --> 01:09:06.328
Kamalasana.

01:09:08.658 --> 01:09:10.571
What are you talking?
- He told everything.

01:09:10.777 --> 01:09:11.863
What did you tell?

01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:15.639
Why do you need it when
we the elders are talking?

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:17.767
Doctor Devashish,
it's enough now, let's go now.

01:09:17.847 --> 01:09:19.819
What he will think about us
when he comes at the festival day?

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:23.246
What he will think about is...
- Nothing he will think about it.

01:09:23.748 --> 01:09:26.453
Let's go, doctor. He left.
- He is inside. Come.

01:09:27.224 --> 01:09:29.399
Now, the kamalasana and...

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.287
Sister-in-law give some food
and we will go after having it.

01:09:32.367 --> 01:09:34.034
Das, why idlys when
I prepared this much like

01:09:34.114 --> 01:09:36.685
Garelu, Boorelu, Chakkarapongala,
Lemon rice for today is a festival.

01:09:36.765 --> 01:09:37.595
Have it.

01:09:37.675 --> 01:09:39.200
Doesn't he move from here
until we eat all these items?

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.412
Get the lemon rice.

01:09:58.172 --> 01:09:59.278
It is good.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.991
I never thought that the
home food is such delicious.

01:10:05.298 --> 01:10:07.038
Don't you have a family?

01:10:07.567 --> 01:10:08.696
No.

01:10:09.735 --> 01:10:12.255
Is our family is not your family?

01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:14.845
Have this ginger pickle.
- Yes.

01:10:15.923 --> 01:10:19.604
Dasu, the food I had
these days are cancelled.

01:10:19.684 --> 01:10:22.543
I thought I had taken
the food first time.

01:10:22.623 --> 01:10:23.955
Then, take a bath so that you get
a feeling of taking bath first time.

01:10:24.035 --> 01:10:25.476
You come, we don't have enough time.

01:10:25.556 --> 01:10:27.190
Hey!
- Doctor Devashis.

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:29.645
When do we sit for exercises?

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.050
Doctor, what about the exercises?

01:10:31.805 --> 01:10:34.276
[indistinct chatter continnue]

01:10:49.557 --> 01:10:52.313
CC TV cameras also switched off sir.
There is no footage for that.

01:11:08.152 --> 01:11:10.572
It definitely looks
like an attack on Deva.

01:11:13.688 --> 01:11:16.092
Excuse me, who are you?

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.003
I came to the restaurant.
Is there any problem?

01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:21.634
No problem, you carry on please.

01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:23.492
Just a minute,

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.235
I feel like I have
seen you somewhere before.

01:11:30.315 --> 01:11:31.778
What is your name?
- Deva, sir.

01:11:32.061 --> 01:11:35.120
Sir, Deva's people have
occupied the entire fifth floor

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.959
giving wrong credentials
that they belongs to music brand.

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:40.994
Deva the musician, good to hear.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:41.472 --> 01:11:42.923
What's your profession?

01:11:44.178 --> 01:11:45.065
I'm a doctor.

01:11:45.145 --> 01:11:46.911
Is it a private
practice or hospital?

01:11:46.991 --> 01:11:48.578
Medimax! Mumbai branch.

01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:50.238
I came to Hyderabad on a work.

01:11:50.318 --> 01:11:53.196
Sorry, don't mind me,
it's a part of my job, carry on.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.833
Sir, Deva might have
included among in died people.

01:11:59.913 --> 01:12:01.234
No chance like that.

01:12:03.424 --> 01:12:04.649
Excuse me, doctor.

01:12:06.825 --> 01:12:09.192
On security reasons,
can you please go from this way?

01:12:11.356 --> 01:12:14.634
Sir, we got seven cell phones
and eighteen guns from their room.

01:12:16.079 --> 01:12:17.239
'Guns.'

01:12:25.462 --> 01:12:28.088
The wind shouldn't go into the ears.

01:12:30.454 --> 01:12:33.467
I have to talk with you
personally before grandma.

01:12:33.547 --> 01:12:35.640
How many days he is going to live?

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.931
Your grandfather doesn't
have any diseases.

01:12:37.011 --> 01:12:38.484
He has only disease of hypocandiac

01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:40.414
which he feels that
he has all diseases.

01:12:41.077 --> 01:12:43.559
You asked for one month treatment?

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:47.910
Not for your grandfather,
it is for you.

01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.999
For me?

01:12:49.079 --> 01:12:52.864
Something happened in my heart

01:12:53.591 --> 01:12:55.908
when I saw you first time.

01:12:56.242 --> 01:12:57.437
Phone is ringing.

01:12:57.517 --> 01:12:59.227
No, that is a different sound.

01:12:59.307 --> 01:13:01.055
No, the phone is ringing.

01:13:01.135 --> 01:13:02.038
Oh!

01:13:03.352 --> 01:13:04.321
Hello.
- Gold.

01:13:04.401 --> 01:13:06.100
You called me in the correct
time when I'm trying to tell.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.276
At what places we
roam around last night?

01:13:07.356 --> 01:13:09.428
Only half I remember.
Why are you asking now?

01:13:09.508 --> 01:13:10.925
My gun is missing.

01:13:11.005 --> 01:13:14.943
Search it otherwise buy a new one.
- May be I have left it in your home.

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:15.993
At my home?

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:24.651
I have an urgent work.
I'll come back later.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:25.878
Bye.

01:13:25.958 --> 01:13:27.128
Sir.

01:13:47.542 --> 01:13:48.939
Hey, what are you doing?

01:13:49.019 --> 01:13:50.583
Sister-in-law...
- He is killing me.

01:13:50.663 --> 01:13:51.513
Yes.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:52.444
Sister-in-law,
did you clean my room?

01:13:52.524 --> 01:13:53.915
Yes. You want it?

01:13:53.995 --> 01:13:55.912
Have you find out a thing

01:13:55.992 --> 01:13:58.634
which has a measure of half
kilo with golden metallic color?

01:13:58.714 --> 01:14:01.004
I only took that.
- Why did you took that?

01:14:01.084 --> 01:14:02.382
I thought I give it
after complete the work.

01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:05.075
What are you going to do with that?
- Shooting?

01:14:05.334 --> 01:14:07.110
Not suiting, it is shaving only.

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:08.356
You are asking about
the trimmer only no?

01:14:08.436 --> 01:14:09.458
Not about trimmer brother.

01:14:09.538 --> 01:14:11.396
Hey, hands-up.
- You calm down.

01:14:17.785 --> 01:14:19.811
Who has given it to you?
- Uncle gave it.

01:14:19.891 --> 01:14:21.004
Oh!

01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:24.072
Hey Chintu, give it to me.

01:14:24.152 --> 01:14:25.690
I'll shoot you if you come nearer.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:27.951
Why he overreacting?
Do one thing.

01:14:27.432 --> 01:14:30.191
Shoot your mother.
She is lazying since morning.

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:33.277
Shoot him only. I am fed
up of him and his medical shop.

01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:35.868
Say anything about me but don't
say a word about my medical shop.

01:14:35.948 --> 01:14:37.136
Why did you drag me into this then?

01:14:37.216 --> 01:14:39.496
Will you keep quiet if
I speak about other women?

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.944
You should never speak ill of me.

01:14:42.024 --> 01:14:44.168
Dad, I will shoot you.
- Hey!

01:14:44.248 --> 01:14:45.748
Uncle, I will shoot you.

01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:48.217
That's best.
Shoot your uncle. I have work to do.

01:14:48.325 --> 01:14:49.631
I will shoot you.

01:14:49.711 --> 01:14:54.148
No, please. Don't shoot me.
Give the gun to me.

01:14:54.228 --> 01:14:56.723
No, I won't. I will shoot.

01:14:56.803 --> 01:15:01.139
Then shoot! If one Sitaramaraju
dies, there will be many.

01:15:01.219 --> 01:15:04.503
that will be born to revolt
against your British empire.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.803
It is true.

01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:12.412
I will shoot.

01:15:12.492 --> 01:15:15.928
Don't do it.
I will die if you shoot.

01:15:16.008 --> 01:15:17.619
I am not Sitaramaraju anyway.

01:15:17.699 --> 01:15:20.305
Just a tailor.
- Still I will shoot.

01:15:48.346 --> 01:15:51.941
Had that bullet hit someone,
they would have died.

01:15:53.344 --> 01:15:55.090
It is dangerous to
be with such people.

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.075
Listen to me and inform the police.

01:15:57.834 --> 01:15:58.847
Police?!

01:15:58.927 --> 01:16:00.338
Why do you worry?

01:16:00.418 --> 01:16:01.502
He is my friend.

01:16:02.388 --> 01:16:03.520
Friend?!

01:16:05.626 --> 01:16:09.764
Yes, I don't know how and
when but he became my friend, sir.

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.130
Everyone sees a
dangerous man in Deva

01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:17.502
but I see the normal man in him.

01:16:17.996 --> 01:16:21.041
We must change him somehow.

01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:22.969
Change? How?

01:16:29.115 --> 01:16:31.826
Good evening!
Welcome to 99wars news bulletin!

01:16:31.906 --> 01:16:34.840
City is terrorised with gang wars.

01:16:35.126 --> 01:16:36.593
Excuse me!
- Yes?

01:16:36.673 --> 01:16:39.990
Who is Jahnavi here?
- Jahnavi... she will be there.

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:44.140
On completion of
thousand episode telecast

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.426
the serial unit is going
to every house without invitation...

01:16:49.107 --> 01:16:50.173
Is this news?

01:16:50.778 --> 01:16:52.468
Madam! We are online...

01:16:52.548 --> 01:16:53.629
Who is she, sir?

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:55.968
His lover. Ex-lover!

01:16:56.107 --> 01:16:59.378
If we want him to change his focus
we have to bring them together.

01:16:59.618 --> 01:17:02.739
Enough, sir.
I cannot read these garbage news.

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:03.752
Five years!

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:06.605
I am asking you since five years
that I like crime investigations.

01:17:06.685 --> 01:17:08.793
I gave you two chances.
What did you do?

01:17:08.873 --> 01:17:11.420
News about pickpocket in
a bus and slippers thief at temple.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.268
Is there anything sensational
in that? Try for a sensational news.

01:17:14.348 --> 01:17:16.824
We should talk about it later.
Finish the news first.

01:17:16.952 --> 01:17:19.910
You do it yourself.
- Jahnavi!

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.824
No one really understand my...

01:17:22.968 --> 01:17:26.847
Excuse me! I am Dr Das,
MBBS, MS, Gold medalist!

01:17:26.927 --> 01:17:29.676
He is Dr Kuchipudi!
Just psychiatrist.

01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:32.408
I am Jahnavi, TV artist. So what?

01:17:32.488 --> 01:17:34.618
Even in anger I think
it is not proper to just

01:17:34.698 --> 01:17:36.275
walk away in the middle like that.

01:17:36.355 --> 01:17:39.202
It's my job and I will do what
I want. Who are you to question me?

01:17:39.282 --> 01:17:42.098
Job?! I was talking
about love matter.

01:17:42.178 --> 01:17:44.502
Love matter?! My love matter?!

01:17:44.768 --> 01:17:46.385
I mean, it is common
to make mistakes in life.

01:17:46.465 --> 01:17:48.285
We should just compromise sometimes.

01:17:48.365 --> 01:17:52.456
Exactly!
Adjustments are common in life.

01:17:52.536 --> 01:17:55.370
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

01:17:55.543 --> 01:17:57.876
Who made you read news
papers when you were young?

01:17:57.956 --> 01:17:59.258
My friend.
- A friend then...

01:17:59.338 --> 01:18:00.299
Later a boyfriend.

01:18:00.564 --> 01:18:02.043
Then lover.
- After marriage a husband.

01:18:02.123 --> 01:18:04.085
After that a father to your kids.
- That is too far in future.

01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:10.578
Listen! It seems you are
mistaking me for someone else.

01:18:10.815 --> 01:18:13.195
I am already irritated. Now move!

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:15.437
It seems we have
no option but to sing.

01:18:15.517 --> 01:18:17.186
Song? Okay.

01:18:44.984 --> 01:18:47.202
Is it not possible

01:18:47.282 --> 01:18:49.602
that his love story too
is fake like all other things?

01:18:49.857 --> 01:18:52.652
It may be, sir. But not entirely.

01:18:52.964 --> 01:18:56.153
Every time he spoke about
Jahnavi I saw a shine in his eyes.

01:18:56.568 --> 01:18:57.683
That means half
of his story is true.

01:18:58.313 --> 01:19:00.583
We have to make the
other half also true.

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:03.931
They are mafia, sir.
One shouldn't mess with them.

01:19:04.138 --> 01:19:06.781
We are doctors, sir.
People shouldn't lie to us.

01:19:09.023 --> 01:19:10.572
What will you do now?

01:19:16.772 --> 01:19:21.035
Since one month every paper
is filled with news about Deva.

01:19:21.271 --> 01:19:24.060
With a question about
what the police are doing.

01:19:24.377 --> 01:19:26.197
He committed eight
murders till now and

01:19:26.277 --> 01:19:27.775
we couldn't find even a single clue.

01:19:27.855 --> 01:19:29.033
What's happening, Sharma?

01:19:29.113 --> 01:19:30.750
What do you want me to say, sir?

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:32.845
He is escaping the
law since 25years.

01:19:33.011 --> 01:19:34.879
How do you expect us
to catch him in a month?

01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:37.926
Give us some time, sir.
We will trap him.

01:19:38.729 --> 01:19:40.618
He is erasing his
foot steps very smartly.

01:19:40.698 --> 01:19:42.489
We too should act
smartly to trap him.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:43.568
What do you mean?

01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:45.195
Sir, we are running
few undercover operations.

01:19:45.275 --> 01:19:46.806
But one we are very close to.

01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:03.970
Sir, this is Puja! The
undercover officer I spoke about.

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:05.313
Puja!
- Sir!

01:20:06.892 --> 01:20:08.712
We have a clue that Deva

01:20:08.792 --> 01:20:10.974
took treatment in a
small clinic in Dhulpet.

01:20:11.054 --> 01:20:12.690
We went there as patients.

01:20:12.863 --> 01:20:15.658
It seems the doctor
and Deva are close.

01:20:15.738 --> 01:20:19.380
If we have some time we
will definitely catch Deva, sir.

01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:34.614
Hey, move!

01:20:34.694 --> 01:20:36.254
He is my son.

01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:25.510
Deva!

01:21:44.304 --> 01:21:47.127
This is Das speaking.
I met your Jahnavi just now.

01:21:47.207 --> 01:21:48.125
Jahnavi?!

01:21:48.205 --> 01:21:50.327
She was excited when
I told her about you.

01:21:51.526 --> 01:21:52.644
You should have been here.

01:21:52.724 --> 01:21:53.730
Hey, what are you talking about?

01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:54.776
I want you to talk to her directly.

01:21:54.856 --> 01:21:58.694
She said she will meet
you at 5pm tomorrow at park.

01:21:59.961 --> 01:22:01.369
You said she likes blue colour.

01:22:01.806 --> 01:22:03.454
So she asked you to wear blue shirt.

01:22:03.534 --> 01:22:04.556
Hey, listen.

01:22:07.218 --> 01:22:09.166
Now Deva and Jahnavi set .

01:22:09.246 --> 01:22:11.407
And everything for Das is also set.

01:22:11.567 --> 01:22:13.294
I don't have to fear anything.

01:22:15.836 --> 01:22:16.766
Just tyre!

01:22:36.438 --> 01:22:37.377
David!

01:22:38.293 --> 01:22:39.383
Let us get out.

01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:40.561
They will kill us.

01:22:41.463 --> 01:22:42.420
Who?

01:22:44.036 --> 01:22:45.055
Deva's men.

01:22:50.309 --> 01:22:53.050
There will be some person
that is dear to him too.

01:22:57.034 --> 01:22:58.543
I need to find him.

01:23:04.154 --> 01:23:07.214
Hey! Who are you?

01:23:07.294 --> 01:23:08.494
Where...

01:23:10.707 --> 01:23:12.152
Hey, I am telling
you this is not right.

01:23:12.232 --> 01:23:14.548
What will you do?

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.458
That day...

01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:21.469
Why did you do that?
- What did you do?

01:23:21.549 --> 01:23:22.528
You keep quiet.

01:23:22.712 --> 01:23:24.332
Why did you do that?

01:23:38.236 --> 01:23:39.802
What's so funny?

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:42.548
What's with this formal getup?

01:23:42.628 --> 01:23:44.485
Do you know how you look?
- Hey!

01:23:44.565 --> 01:23:46.135
Do you know what you did?

01:23:46.302 --> 01:23:47.558
What?

01:24:06.051 --> 01:24:07.036
Hi!

01:24:10.374 --> 01:24:13.175
Who painted this?
MF Hussain or Ravi Varma?

01:24:14.077 --> 01:24:15.306
Sharma of our neighbourhood.

01:24:16.789 --> 01:24:18.245
Madam is calling you, sir.

01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:22.662
Hi!

01:24:23.226 --> 01:24:24.554
Hello.
- Hi, sir!

01:24:24.634 --> 01:24:25.977
I am TV reporter Jahnavi.

01:24:26.057 --> 01:24:29.786
Yeah! Yeah, I remember.
Jahnavi! I am...

01:24:29.866 --> 01:24:33.463
Vikram Kumar! CBI agent, right?

01:24:35.664 --> 01:24:37.373
You called me yesterday.

01:24:38.033 --> 01:24:39.153
Did I call you?!

01:24:40.335 --> 01:24:41.978
'Hello! Is this miss Jahnavi?'

01:24:42.058 --> 01:24:43.718
Yes, this is Jahnavi here.
Who is this?

01:24:43.798 --> 01:24:45.466
I am from CBI.

01:24:45.546 --> 01:24:46.706
How many times should
I tell you guys

01:24:46.786 --> 01:24:48.898
that I don't want any
loans or credit cards?

01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:51.724
Madam, I said CBI not SBI.

01:24:51.804 --> 01:24:52.901
CBI?!

01:24:53.539 --> 01:24:56.016
Sorry, sir. You are...

01:24:56.096 --> 01:25:00.043
I am... Vikram. Vikram Kumar!

01:25:00.123 --> 01:25:03.659
We are going to start a
big undercover operation soon.

01:25:03.739 --> 01:25:07.744
For that we need a
talented reporter like you.

01:25:07.824 --> 01:25:08.723
Really?

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:11.319
Yes. Shall we meet at
park hotel at 5pm tomorrow.

01:25:11.399 --> 01:25:13.609
Sure sir.
- I will be wearing blue.

01:25:13.689 --> 01:25:16.498
You wear white.
It looks nice to see.

01:25:21.509 --> 01:25:24.421
What happened, sir? You look tensed.

01:25:24.549 --> 01:25:26.386
Actually this meeting...

01:25:26.466 --> 01:25:27.726
I will not speak to anyone about it.

01:25:27.806 --> 01:25:28.971
Madam, order?

01:25:29.051 --> 01:25:31.566
One chocolate milkshake.
What do you have?

01:25:31.646 --> 01:25:35.026
Wisky! No, rum! Coffee!
- Okay, sir.

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:38.958
If you contacted me earlier

01:25:39.038 --> 01:25:41.802
we would have sent that
criminal to jail by now.

01:25:41.882 --> 01:25:44.758
Not too late,
we can catch that fellow very soon.

01:25:45.145 --> 01:25:46.501
Can you clarify something?

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.921
You have been cursing
him a lot but what is his name?

01:25:50.001 --> 01:25:51.841
He might die just by
hearing you cursing him.

01:25:52.003 --> 01:25:53.179
Who else, sir?

01:25:53.632 --> 01:25:55.442
I am talking about that
horrible criminal Deva.

01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:59.468
Deva?!

01:26:10.517 --> 01:26:11.686
Deva!

01:26:11.808 --> 01:26:14.185
Yes, that is what you said.

01:26:14.326 --> 01:26:15.360
I said so.

01:26:33.256 --> 01:26:34.314
Why did you tell her
my name as the criminal?

01:26:34.394 --> 01:26:35.286
How am I supposed to
know a criminal name suddenly?

01:26:35.366 --> 01:26:37.192
I am not some jail warden
to know criminal names.

01:26:37.272 --> 01:26:39.326
So you want me to work
with her to get captured?

01:26:39.406 --> 01:26:40.517
Why did you lie to
her in the first place?

01:26:40.597 --> 01:26:42.756
Why did you lie to
me about your love story?

01:26:42.836 --> 01:26:45.119
I thought it was true. Went
to speak to her and got slapped.

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:47.922
Then I won't meet
her or speak to her.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.124
I won't even answer her phone calls.

01:26:53.926 --> 01:26:58.025
Jahnavi! Hello!
I am waiting for your phone call.

01:26:59.243 --> 01:27:02.584
Ten o'clock?
Ok, I'll come. No problem at all.

01:27:03.714 --> 01:27:05.044
Okay? Bye!

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:09.255
I won't talk to her at all?

01:27:15.686 --> 01:27:16.916
It's working.

01:27:30.066 --> 01:27:31.367
Rajan?
- Deva, Russia deal...

01:27:31.447 --> 01:27:32.503
Not about that deal.

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:36.310
I want all the information about
Deva's dealings and activities.

01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:38.419
What for?
- For publicity.

01:28:39.108 --> 01:28:40.326
Handsome.

01:28:42.858 --> 01:28:44.934
Deva! Deva!

01:28:45.014 --> 01:28:48.570
You should say 'narayana'
before you die not Deva.

01:29:08.772 --> 01:29:10.665
What? Who is doing all this?

01:30:35.143 --> 01:30:37.437
Hi! Happy friendship Day.

01:30:37.517 --> 01:30:38.573
Same to you.
- She is my friend Deepti.

01:30:38.653 --> 01:30:39.694
Hello.

01:30:39.774 --> 01:30:40.892
Did you not bring
any of your friends?

01:30:40.972 --> 01:30:42.611
The only friend I have is d...

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:50.389
I don't have any friends.
Please let us sit down

01:32:09.537 --> 01:32:11.571
It's raining heavily.

01:32:12.212 --> 01:32:14.656
Yes. I take my leave now.

01:32:14.736 --> 01:32:15.906
How are you going to go?

01:32:16.454 --> 01:32:18.037
Roads will be blocked now.

01:32:18.896 --> 01:32:21.968
It's okay.
- Come inside. Please come.

01:32:25.179 --> 01:32:27.465
Isn't it very cold?
- I am fine.

01:32:28.566 --> 01:32:30.310
Okay, I'll go and change.
- Please!

01:32:54.099 --> 01:32:55.621
What do you think of my house?

01:33:05.838 --> 01:33:08.786
You are beautiful.
I mean your house is beautiful.

01:33:09.996 --> 01:33:12.134
It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:33:14.597 --> 01:33:21.218
Sorry! Sorry! Here, dry yourself.
- Thank you.

01:33:22.613 --> 01:33:23.948
What is that?
- What?

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:27.588
Sit! I will do it.

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.426
No! It's okay.
- It's alright.

01:33:45.471 --> 01:33:47.215
Do you have something to say?

01:33:47.295 --> 01:33:48.411
No.

01:33:48.888 --> 01:33:50.252
I will go prepare the food.

01:34:03.055 --> 01:34:05.389
Madam! Das got a call
from some new number.

01:34:06.089 --> 01:34:07.236
Okay, connect.

01:34:09.587 --> 01:34:10.925
Hello!
- Hello.

01:34:11.124 --> 01:34:12.257
Das! It's me.

01:34:12.337 --> 01:34:13.670
How should I know without
you telling the name?

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:15.785
Hello, Mr Vikram!
- Vikram Kumar.

01:34:15.865 --> 01:34:19.156
Vikram Kumar sir! Is that you?
It has been long since I saw you.

01:34:19.236 --> 01:34:21.454
One minute!
- Is potato fry and dal okay?

01:34:21.534 --> 01:34:22.473
Okay.
- Okay.

01:34:22.553 --> 01:34:24.794
Potato fry and dal?
Yes, she is making it.

01:34:24.874 --> 01:34:26.539
Why don't you make some lemon rice.

01:34:26.799 --> 01:34:29.881
Then is this what you do
when a girl invites you home?

01:34:29.961 --> 01:34:31.010
Be romantic, man.

01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:33.478
That's all regular.

01:34:34.804 --> 01:34:36.301
She is special.

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:41.242
I want to kiss her and
I don't know how to proceed.

01:34:41.322 --> 01:34:43.587
Even though it is wrong time,
you called the right person.

01:34:43.802 --> 01:34:46.215
I have a lot of
experience in such things.

01:34:47.301 --> 01:34:49.391
Did you kiss anyone?
- Yes?

01:34:49.471 --> 01:34:52.555
You should ask what kind
os kisses I expertise in.

01:34:52.757 --> 01:35:00.394
Starting from peck, smooch, French,
Chinese and Japan, I know all kinds.

01:35:00.521 --> 01:35:02.304
They are just different languages.

01:35:02.442 --> 01:35:03.743
If you disturb my
flow I will cut the call.

01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:05.122
Hey, sorry! Sorry! Tell me.

01:35:06.491 --> 01:35:10.255
Recently Puja came to
my house and into my room.

01:35:10.845 --> 01:35:12.533
There was a strange
silence between us.

01:35:13.213 --> 01:35:18.105
We were staring into each other's
eyes moving closer little by little.

01:35:18.271 --> 01:35:19.854
Hey tell me what happened next?

01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:21.338
Next...

01:35:21.418 --> 01:35:24.228
Hey, wake up! How many times should
I tell you not to sleep in hospital?

01:35:24.308 --> 01:35:26.746
You will get nightmares.
Go to your home.

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:28.705
Sorry, sir!

01:35:30.232 --> 01:35:34.915
Where was I?
Yeah, looking into the eyes...

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:36.514
After that?

01:35:36.594 --> 01:35:42.927
I put a hand one her
wrist and another on her

01:35:43.007 --> 01:35:47.247
shoulder and pulled her closer...

01:35:50.575 --> 01:35:52.167
What is this nonsense?

01:35:53.219 --> 01:35:54.748
Dal and fry!

01:35:57.489 --> 01:36:00.270
Is that all?
- Yes. Proceed!

01:36:00.951 --> 01:36:02.394
Das! So should I kiss her?

01:36:02.474 --> 01:36:06.933
Yes, do it.
- Okay, I'll. Okay. Cut the call.

01:36:07.013 --> 01:36:09.116
Proceed.
- Okay.

01:36:10.833 --> 01:36:11.980
He cut the call.

01:36:26.552 --> 01:36:32.414
Seeing your condition
breaks my heart, sir.

01:36:32.494 --> 01:36:35.204
Hey! Jakie! It's not like that.

01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:29.618
Hi!
- Hi!

01:37:31.809 --> 01:37:33.536
Am I still in dream?

01:37:41.454 --> 01:37:42.572
Why did you come?

01:37:42.995 --> 01:37:45.289
She is talking without manners.

01:37:45.369 --> 01:37:46.519
Didn't you inform
her about marriage talks?

01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:47.945
Marriage talks?!

01:37:48.025 --> 01:37:49.140
I wanted to surprise you.

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.195
Puja! Who is that?

01:37:51.275 --> 01:37:53.606
Daddy! My friend's family.

01:37:53.973 --> 01:37:56.727
Why did you keep them out then?
Ask them to come in.

01:37:56.807 --> 01:37:58.985
Please come.

01:37:59.976 --> 01:38:01.517
Please come, have a seat.

01:38:01.597 --> 01:38:03.928
I will bring coffee.
- Greetings, sir.

01:38:04.008 --> 01:38:05.593
Sit!
- Greetings.

01:38:07.428 --> 01:38:08.633
Sit here.

01:38:08.713 --> 01:38:09.695
So, you too are in the
same department as my daughter?

01:38:09.775 --> 01:38:13.649
I am Doctor, sir. Gold medalist.

01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:15.182
How do you know my daughter then?

01:38:15.866 --> 01:38:19.199
Your daughter always comes
to his clinic with her grandpa.

01:38:19.525 --> 01:38:20.581
Grandpa?!

01:38:21.672 --> 01:38:26.582
Dad! I took Tatarao to
the clinic when he was sick.

01:38:27.822 --> 01:38:29.598
Where is your grandpa now?

01:38:29.678 --> 01:38:31.989
Not grandpa, his name is Tatarao.

01:38:32.069 --> 01:38:34.618
How can he talk so rudely about
his father? Seems mannerless people.

01:38:34.698 --> 01:38:36.893
I don't think we should interfere.
- Yes.

01:38:37.226 --> 01:38:40.530
The vegetables rates
are very high these days.

01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:43.762
We were talking about you just now,
sir. Please give them to me.

01:38:43.842 --> 01:38:45.738
Greetings, sir.
- Greeting.

01:38:46.313 --> 01:38:48.040
Why is he behaving like that?

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.539
Please make your
son and daughter-in-law

01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:51.140
agree to our marriage.

01:38:51.306 --> 01:38:53.863
Marriage?!
- Is there a reason for your visit?

01:38:56.415 --> 01:38:58.068
I think your daughter
might have told you.

01:38:58.412 --> 01:39:00.177
My brother is very innocent person

01:39:01.058 --> 01:39:02.774
when he saw your
daughter first time...

01:39:02.854 --> 01:39:06.361
I heard the vegetable prices
in your area are less, is it true?

01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:09.704
Shut up! You don't
know when to speak what!

01:39:09.784 --> 01:39:12.305
Sir! Is this any way
to speak to your father?

01:39:12.385 --> 01:39:13.517
My father?
Who are you talking about?

01:39:13.645 --> 01:39:15.833
Your father.
- My father died a long time ago.

01:39:20.885 --> 01:39:23.824
My son too died.
I won't stay in this house.

01:39:23.993 --> 01:39:25.233
No, grandfather!

01:39:25.441 --> 01:39:27.336
Deal with your issues later.
My marriage...

01:39:27.531 --> 01:39:29.891
Stop this now. Whose marriage?

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.168
Me and...

01:39:33.248 --> 01:39:34.413
My God!

01:39:35.467 --> 01:39:36.866
What?!
- My heart!

01:39:37.908 --> 01:39:38.984
That will be on the other side.

01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:42.598
Grandfather!

01:39:42.735 --> 01:39:44.396
He suddenly fell.

01:39:44.476 --> 01:39:45.702
Fell...

01:39:47.021 --> 01:39:47.942
I am sorry, sir.

01:39:48.022 --> 01:39:50.366
Sorry for what?
- Oh, it's a miracle, sir.

01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:52.799
Das, my child!
Please save me. I beg you.

01:39:52.879 --> 01:39:54.242
Don't worry. You will be alright.

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:55.849
Yes, grandpa.
- You please be silent.

01:39:55.929 --> 01:39:57.519
This is all because of you.
- Everything was fine.

01:39:57.599 --> 01:39:58.768
Everything was fine.
Why did you get a stroke?

01:39:58.848 --> 01:40:03.456
Happy! It was overwhelming
to cover so many people.

01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:06.250
Cover?!
- About our marriage...

01:40:08.354 --> 01:40:09.846
I don't understand...

01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:11.753
Can you read?

01:40:11.833 --> 01:40:13.414
It will be a surprise if
you can understand your writing.

01:40:14.694 --> 01:40:15.912
You take blood samples meanwhile.

01:40:16.959 --> 01:40:20.467
These doctors have high
study but lack common sense.

01:40:21.928 --> 01:40:24.605
Just have patience for two days.
I will definitely catch Deva.

01:40:26.744 --> 01:40:30.439
It seems my going to heavens
will happen before that.

01:40:30.953 --> 01:40:31.977
Hi, Deva!

01:40:32.289 --> 01:40:34.171
O God!

01:40:35.093 --> 01:40:36.270
What are you doing here?

01:40:37.003 --> 01:40:39.916
Hey, why are you scared? Come here!

01:40:39.996 --> 01:40:41.438
Who is here to watch? Come here.

01:40:41.518 --> 01:40:43.598
Come here! Come!

01:40:44.297 --> 01:40:46.379
Last night Jahnavi almost...

01:40:46.459 --> 01:40:47.888
Puja, not Jahnavi.

01:40:47.968 --> 01:40:49.570
Jahnavi, not Puja.

01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:50.746
I am saying Puja is inside.

01:40:50.826 --> 01:40:52.421
Is she? I will speak
to her once then.

01:40:52.621 --> 01:40:54.123
Do you want to speak with her?!
Are you drunk?

01:40:55.693 --> 01:40:58.246
I finished half the bottle
on the way. Now let us finish it.

01:40:58.326 --> 01:40:59.449
Come on, sit down.

01:41:01.525 --> 01:41:03.808
I am begging you.
Please be a good guy.

01:41:03.888 --> 01:41:05.883
It would be a problem
if Puja sees you. Please!

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.457
We are talking and drinking
together. That's fixed.

01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:12.192
Lower your voice!

01:41:12.272 --> 01:41:14.856
Let us drink together tomorrow.
How many bottles as you wish to.

01:41:15.395 --> 01:41:16.779
Please say okay.

01:41:17.056 --> 01:41:18.170
Okay.

01:41:18.703 --> 01:41:19.914
Where are the glasses?

01:41:21.835 --> 01:41:22.999
Deva!

01:41:23.079 --> 01:41:24.314
O God!

01:41:24.792 --> 01:41:26.041
Why are you calling God?

01:41:26.121 --> 01:41:29.457
We are doing all this
to keep you down here.

01:41:30.045 --> 01:41:31.197
What are you doing?

01:41:31.277 --> 01:41:34.585
I can thread a needle nicely
but cannot find the nerve properly.

01:41:36.439 --> 01:41:38.188
Are you a tailor?

01:41:40.752 --> 01:41:42.629
What is that? Sir, catch this.

01:41:43.425 --> 01:41:44.676
Hey, have it.

01:41:45.883 --> 01:41:46.945
Okay, Chee...

01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:50.957
Okay? Can I go now?

01:41:51.037 --> 01:41:52.574
Why didn't you wait for cheers?!

01:41:53.979 --> 01:41:55.983
No problem.
Let me fill your glass again.

01:41:56.741 --> 01:42:00.185
Madam! Madam! Madam!

01:42:00.265 --> 01:42:01.690
You shouldn't go into that
room now. - Why is that?

01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:04.827
It seems it started early today.
Doors are shut by seven.

01:42:04.907 --> 01:42:06.358
Return to your grandfather's side.
- Who is in there?

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:09.161
Why don't you understand?
Sir will not meet you now.

01:42:12.558 --> 01:42:14.366
I have to stitch so many
clothes to get this much money.

01:42:15.009 --> 01:42:16.664
Don't tell him that I told you this.

01:42:16.744 --> 01:42:19.580
I don't know whether same girl
comes everyday or different girls.

01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:21.219
Doors will be closed
by this time everyday.

01:42:21.299 --> 01:42:23.262
We can hear laughing
and other sounds.

01:42:23.787 --> 01:42:25.452
He will come out
in the morning tired.

01:42:27.623 --> 01:42:28.828
Madam!

01:42:35.572 --> 01:42:37.518
Come on, have one more peg.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:43.142
You are my dear gold. Please!

01:42:59.393 --> 01:43:02.341
Food was wonderful. It was tastier
than the one made at your home.

01:43:02.421 --> 01:43:04.818
Jahnavi made it. Jahnavi.

01:43:09.502 --> 01:43:11.162
Das!

01:43:15.079 --> 01:43:16.193
Hey, Das!

01:43:20.476 --> 01:43:23.652
Das! I used to like it
when people were afraid of me.

01:43:23.898 --> 01:43:25.293
But I like it more
when people don't fear me.

01:43:25.373 --> 01:43:27.922
I found that after seeing you.

01:43:29.038 --> 01:43:33.449
Not me. Jahnavi! I know your secret.

01:43:34.346 --> 01:43:36.759
I don't know why but I am scared.

01:43:36.839 --> 01:43:39.241
O my God! Are you scared?

01:43:41.083 --> 01:43:44.464
So even Deva came
to know what fear is.

01:43:46.341 --> 01:43:48.321
Generally people fear
for only one thing, Deva.

01:43:49.342 --> 01:43:51.515
That is about death.

01:43:52.959 --> 01:43:56.496
But the fear of losing
someone who we love is greatest.

01:43:59.083 --> 01:44:02.847
Change yourself, Deva!
Change back into a good person.

01:44:04.777 --> 01:44:08.447
You don't need money
or power to live among people.

01:44:10.051 --> 01:44:12.619
A bit of smiles and
a bit of love are enough.

01:44:12.918 --> 01:44:14.512
Life will become beautiful for you.

01:44:18.939 --> 01:44:22.354
It would have been nice if someone
told me this twenty years back.

01:44:25.868 --> 01:44:27.423
It's late. I have to go now.

01:44:29.538 --> 01:44:31.503
What if Jahnavi knows
the truth someday?

01:44:34.145 --> 01:44:35.544
She will leave me.

01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:37.890
Why would she?

01:44:39.445 --> 01:44:40.787
Did I leave you?

01:44:41.593 --> 01:44:42.983
Telling truth might be good.

01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:46.662
But continuing the
lie might ruin your future.

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:49.942
Tell her the truth, Deva.

01:45:06.094 --> 01:45:07.448
Why did you bring me here?

01:45:07.759 --> 01:45:09.449
How long will you hide?

01:45:09.962 --> 01:45:11.234
I will die if I come out.

01:45:12.127 --> 01:45:14.688
Deva knows I too am
involved in the murder.

01:45:15.361 --> 01:45:17.345
If he knows I am in the city,
he will surely kill me.

01:45:17.425 --> 01:45:19.555
That is what I want.
- My death?

01:45:19.767 --> 01:45:21.379
No! He coming out for you.

01:45:21.634 --> 01:45:23.628
I just missed my death that
time because of plan like this.

01:45:23.921 --> 01:45:26.177
I didn't know he would come then.
But now I know.

01:45:26.257 --> 01:45:29.052
Instead of living in fear of him
we can kill him once and for all.

01:45:29.132 --> 01:45:31.674
Be brave for one day and
I will take care of the rest.

01:45:33.516 --> 01:45:34.455
You will take care of me?!

01:45:34.535 --> 01:45:36.775
He killed your brother terribly
that day. What could you do?

01:45:38.581 --> 01:45:43.991
Do what I say otherwise I will
kill you before he has a chance.

01:45:44.257 --> 01:45:45.474
Okay?

01:45:45.816 --> 01:45:47.011
Do you understand?

01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:52.861
My head is hurting a lot.
Bring my glasses.

01:45:52.941 --> 01:45:55.107
Sir! You should reduce
your night programs.

01:45:55.239 --> 01:45:56.754
Give some gap in between, sir.

01:45:58.504 --> 01:46:00.607
What did I ask you and
what are you speaking? Go now.

01:46:02.099 --> 01:46:03.281
Mr Das!

01:46:05.111 --> 01:46:06.005
Mr Das!

01:46:06.085 --> 01:46:08.544
Hi! Can you please message my head?

01:46:08.727 --> 01:46:11.234
If you tell me the bill amount,
I will pay and leave.

01:46:11.314 --> 01:46:14.035
Why would I charge you? Your
grandfather is like my grandfather.

01:46:14.115 --> 01:46:16.465
Don't try to be smart.
Let's be professional.

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:18.236
Tell me how much I have to pay.
- I understood now.

01:46:18.468 --> 01:46:20.333
You are mad that I
left without telling you.

01:46:20.604 --> 01:46:21.645
Sorry, Puja.

01:46:21.725 --> 01:46:25.171
You are lying.
Someone came for you last night.

01:46:25.885 --> 01:46:28.265
You have someone who is
important than me in your life.

01:46:30.285 --> 01:46:32.045
That is why you left me like that.

01:46:32.125 --> 01:46:35.497
You close the door by eight
every night. Isn't that true?

01:46:35.577 --> 01:46:38.409
By the way is it the same
girl or different girl every night?

01:46:38.489 --> 01:46:40.230
How could you believe
that nonsense that he sprouts?

01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:41.265
Don't you know about me?

01:46:41.345 --> 01:46:43.677
Will you answer me truthfully
if I ask something?

01:46:43.796 --> 01:46:45.456
Of course!
- With whom did you go out yesterday?

01:46:45.536 --> 01:46:46.530
Pass!

01:46:47.678 --> 01:46:48.878
Puja! Puja!

01:46:48.958 --> 01:46:51.375
Puja! Please wait!

01:46:51.455 --> 01:46:54.224
The person I meet daily and
go out is a male and not a female.

01:46:54.654 --> 01:46:55.535
Who is that?

01:46:57.028 --> 01:46:58.055
Secret friend!

01:46:58.135 --> 01:46:59.566
I want to know his name.

01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:05.733
Puja! I told you it is secret.
Try to understand.

01:47:05.813 --> 01:47:08.332
We are not correct for each other.
Keep your secrets with you.

01:47:09.855 --> 01:47:11.347
Is it okay if I bring
him to meet you today evening?

01:47:11.953 --> 01:47:14.092
Okay, at Aawasa hotel
eight o'clock tonight.

01:47:14.433 --> 01:47:15.885
Call me when you reach there.

01:47:18.446 --> 01:47:19.624
Hey.

01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:21.386
Go.
- Hey, Jakie! Come here!

01:47:22.341 --> 01:47:24.382
I really didn't say
anything to her, sir.

01:47:24.462 --> 01:47:27.882
Forget it. Get my phone...
no give me your phone.

01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:32.392
'The number your are
calling is switched off.'

01:47:32.472 --> 01:47:34.935
Swich off.

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.182
Hello?
- Hello, miss Jahnavi!

01:47:46.262 --> 01:47:48.309
This is undercover constable
Kantarao speaking.

01:47:48.389 --> 01:47:49.568
Is Vikram sir there?

01:47:50.392 --> 01:47:53.222
Does constables go undercover too?

01:47:53.699 --> 01:47:54.758
Hello?
- Hello, Deva!

01:47:54.838 --> 01:47:56.702
This is Kantarao...
no Das speaking. Where are you?

01:47:56.782 --> 01:47:59.235
I am eating ice cream with Jahnavi.

01:47:59.315 --> 01:48:02.246
Ice cream?! Your love story
is cool but mine caught fire.

01:48:02.326 --> 01:48:03.354
How? What happened?

01:48:03.434 --> 01:48:05.562
Puja thinks I am meeting
some girl every night.

01:48:05.642 --> 01:48:06.769
But you were meeting me.

01:48:06.849 --> 01:48:07.887
That is why I told
her that I will bring you.

01:48:07.967 --> 01:48:09.431
Did you tell her about Deva?

01:48:09.511 --> 01:48:10.466
No, I told her you are a friend.

01:48:10.546 --> 01:48:12.872
What about Deva?
- We caught Deva's friend.

01:48:12.952 --> 01:48:14.467
Deva's friend? That's me.

01:48:14.547 --> 01:48:16.891
I am speaking with Jahnavi.

01:48:17.046 --> 01:48:18.159
I am speaking with Kantarao.

01:48:18.239 --> 01:48:19.382
One minute!

01:48:19.462 --> 01:48:20.710
Now start your story.

01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:22.752
If you don't meet her,
Puja will break-up with me.

01:48:22.832 --> 01:48:23.870
Are you going to come or not?
- No!

01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:25.779
Then I will talk to Jahnavi.
- I will come. Where to?

01:48:25.859 --> 01:48:26.920
Aawasa hotel, at eight tonight.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.315
Okay.
- See you.

01:48:31.221 --> 01:48:34.940
Telling Jahnavi! I will
never tell her about Jahnavi, sir.

01:49:09.317 --> 01:49:12.200
'Is he coming?'
- Yes, sir. He is one the way.

01:49:13.363 --> 01:49:14.645
That's good.

01:49:16.604 --> 01:49:19.018
As soon as he enters, all the
entries and exists will be closed.

01:49:19.427 --> 01:49:22.388
You handle Das. Be on alert.

01:49:22.658 --> 01:49:23.779
Yes.

01:49:32.002 --> 01:49:34.818
Hey, drive quickly.
I am getting late for the meeting.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:45.314
Ajay!

01:50:03.928 --> 01:50:05.007
David!

01:50:05.354 --> 01:50:07.623
Everyone is on alert.
Everything is set.

01:50:07.703 --> 01:50:11.166
You just has to follow through.
That's it. Nothing will happen.

01:50:11.246 --> 01:50:15.449
It's not good. It will not work out.
Plan is not good.

01:50:17.545 --> 01:50:21.088
Ajay! My men are all around the
place. Don't get tensed. Just wait.

01:50:31.745 --> 01:50:32.879
Where are you going?
- Washroom!

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:35.467
Do you have permission? - Hey,
I don't need permission for that.

01:51:03.238 --> 01:51:05.151
Are you drunk?
- Move.

01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:06.578
Hey, move!

01:51:06.658 --> 01:51:08.991
What are you doing?
Hello! Answer me.

01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:18.510
Sir! Please go slow!
Speed is high! Sir!

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:21.765
Sir! If you stop by that side,
I will get down.

01:51:21.845 --> 01:51:23.282
Hey! Shut up!

01:51:23.659 --> 01:51:24.998
Watch the road, sir.

01:51:34.981 --> 01:51:36.716
Who are they, sir?

01:52:56.961 --> 01:52:58.760
It is okay! It's okay!

01:53:01.336 --> 01:53:02.629
I am a doctor. Get up.

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:04.924
It seems someone is coming.

01:53:05.073 --> 01:53:06.926
Help! Help!

01:53:07.831 --> 01:53:09.207
Please, help!

01:53:11.196 --> 01:53:12.579
We will get help.

01:53:15.876 --> 01:53:17.231
Come fast, please!

01:53:24.352 --> 01:53:25.632
Come and help.

01:53:26.874 --> 01:53:28.332
Come and help.

01:53:28.412 --> 01:53:29.897
Leave him.
- Come fast.

01:53:46.148 --> 01:53:47.502
Come on, get into the car.

01:53:48.325 --> 01:53:49.669
You killed him!

01:53:52.485 --> 01:53:53.805
You killed him!

01:53:55.099 --> 01:53:57.902
You will not understand
even if I explain.

01:54:00.452 --> 01:54:02.031
It is a life, Deva!

01:54:04.389 --> 01:54:06.327
He pleaded to me to save him.

01:54:07.008 --> 01:54:09.351
What is the use?
You killed him in an instant.

01:54:09.764 --> 01:54:11.313
Why did you kill him?

01:54:11.888 --> 01:54:14.629
There is no need to keep
everyone alive in this world.

01:54:15.359 --> 01:54:16.867
He does not have the right to live.

01:54:16.947 --> 01:54:19.291
Do you have that right?
Do you have it?!

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.340
Who are you to decide
who should live or die?

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:23.742
Are you God?!

01:54:24.188 --> 01:54:25.362
Had I assumed that
our few months ago,

01:54:25.442 --> 01:54:26.648
what would have happened to you?

01:54:27.213 --> 01:54:28.924
I am different and he is different.

01:54:33.506 --> 01:54:36.206
Hey, Dasu!

01:54:42.036 --> 01:54:43.998
If this was done by someone else,
what would have happened?

01:54:44.078 --> 01:54:46.674
You would have killed him,
is that all?

01:54:47.574 --> 01:54:48.677
What more can you do?

01:54:49.901 --> 01:54:51.311
You being a killer
have so much ego,

01:54:51.391 --> 01:54:52.901
how much should I
have for saving you?!

01:54:54.596 --> 01:54:58.707
I live in a Jungle
and surrounded by beasts.

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:01.908
Do you know how many have
to die for a lion to live?

01:55:02.687 --> 01:55:04.674
It must kill and keep killing!

01:55:05.777 --> 01:55:07.406
I don't know to live in fear.

01:55:11.339 --> 01:55:12.782
Don't you know what fear is?

01:55:14.055 --> 01:55:15.717
You live in fear every moment.

01:55:15.928 --> 01:55:19.195
You live in fear 24 hours that
someone will come to know about you.

01:55:19.592 --> 01:55:21.279
What is the use of such a life?

01:55:21.855 --> 01:55:24.198
Can you make him alive?
Bring his life back!

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:27.092
Dasu! Don't forget
who you are talking to.

01:55:27.627 --> 01:55:29.751
Deva it is, right?

01:55:30.417 --> 01:55:33.157
I announced my name and
status to a million people.

01:55:34.065 --> 01:55:35.736
Can you tell even to
one person that you are Deva?

01:55:36.156 --> 01:55:37.567
Forget about others.

01:55:37.858 --> 01:55:40.039
Can you say it to the girl you love?

01:55:41.475 --> 01:55:43.988
What is the use of courage only
to kill those who come in your way?

01:55:44.344 --> 01:55:45.877
You need courage
to tell about yourself.

01:55:46.242 --> 01:55:48.163
Do you have the courage?
Do you have it?!

01:55:50.061 --> 01:55:53.207
After today, you are your
people should not contact me.

01:55:54.044 --> 01:55:55.162
You continue your killing spree.

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.230
How can there be friendship
between life and death?

01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:58.560
That is not possible.

01:56:00.733 --> 01:56:03.238
I had a small hope that
you would change someday.

01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:07.421
That is why I requested
you to escape and surrender.

01:56:07.826 --> 01:56:09.164
But now I tell you.

01:56:09.244 --> 01:56:11.864
You will continue to live like
this and have a dastardly death!

01:56:14.281 --> 01:56:18.278
That day there will
be none to cry for you.

01:58:23.679 --> 01:58:26.810
Sir, just missed it!
Otherwise, I would have stabbed.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.810
What are you saying?
Go away from here! - Sir!

01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:31.577
Just go from here!
- Sir!

01:58:31.942 --> 01:58:34.723
Why are you sending
them away like that?

01:58:34.803 --> 01:58:36.790
They are patients!
- No, they are demons.

01:58:37.342 --> 01:58:38.369
If I treat them
and send from here...

01:58:38.449 --> 01:58:39.958
They are killing
others and coming back.

01:58:40.549 --> 01:58:42.384
It is better to keep
records of corpses

01:58:42.464 --> 01:58:43.831
than work for people like them.

01:58:54.799 --> 01:58:57.212
So, you said that you
wanted to speak something.

01:58:57.361 --> 01:58:59.125
It was a mistake not to
take your permission that day.

01:58:59.205 --> 01:59:00.501
It won't happen again, sir.

01:59:00.973 --> 01:59:03.030
General ward,
mortuary, anything is okay, sir.

01:59:03.110 --> 01:59:05.125
What were you doing
the past 3 months?

01:59:05.391 --> 01:59:07.655
There is a clinic in our area.
I worked there.

01:59:07.735 --> 01:59:10.197
Your area means that slum?

01:59:11.989 --> 01:59:13.935
Let me put it straight, Dr Das.

01:59:14.998 --> 01:59:20.064
These corporate hospitals run
more on brand value than service!

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:25.278
So, if I take you back, the hospital
reputation will be tarnished.

01:59:25.863 --> 01:59:27.089
I can't take you back!

01:59:27.309 --> 01:59:28.891
I will give you an
explanation for what happened.

01:59:28.971 --> 01:59:30.390
You may leave the place!

01:59:40.404 --> 01:59:42.778
Sir, the chairman is calling you.

01:59:43.563 --> 01:59:45.321
The chairman?! Where is he?

01:59:45.684 --> 01:59:46.975
He is in that room.

01:59:47.273 --> 01:59:48.538
Excuse me, Sir!

01:59:49.128 --> 01:59:50.250
Come in!

01:59:50.762 --> 01:59:52.151
Sir, me...

01:59:52.624 --> 01:59:54.194
What I was 40 years ago!

01:59:54.375 --> 01:59:57.000
Sir?!
- I mean that you are

01:59:57.213 --> 01:59:59.240
in the same position
where I was 40 years ago.

01:59:59.595 --> 02:00:04.034
Dr seetharamaiah...
MBBS, MS, gold medalist.

02:00:04.967 --> 02:00:07.024
Come and have a seat.

02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:14.109
Das, it is not cancer etc
that kills people from inside.

02:00:14.342 --> 02:00:16.014
It is Pride, ego!

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:19.014
That is the great weakness
that Dr Bharadwaj has.

02:00:19.217 --> 02:00:22.511
He is a doctor and
the chief of a department.

02:00:23.199 --> 02:00:29.229
For me to set him aside and invite
you, you need to prove yourself.

02:00:30.414 --> 02:00:34.072
Next week,
our hospital completes 25 years.

02:00:34.245 --> 02:00:35.532
25 years, silver jubilee.

02:00:35.686 --> 02:00:39.982
On this occasion, we are
planning and organ donation camp.

02:00:40.154 --> 02:00:45.213
Every year many people die
due to non availability of organs.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.312
In every year board meeting,
I put this proposal...

02:00:50.392 --> 02:00:51.519
But they say that
it is not possible,

02:00:51.599 --> 02:00:53.523
and organise some
blood donation camp instead.

02:00:53.603 --> 02:00:56.977
They shelve it like that.
What can we do?

02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.742
I will do it, sir.
I will definitely try.

02:01:01.006 --> 02:01:03.877
Can you take me back in my job?

02:01:04.379 --> 02:01:06.852
I hope to be able to
save at least one life.

02:01:08.012 --> 02:01:10.631
Do you know who is the
main donor of this project?

02:01:11.774 --> 02:01:13.242
My driver Raju!

02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:27.729
I will do it, sir.

02:01:42.916 --> 02:01:44.757
Take this cake and give it to uncle.

02:01:44.935 --> 02:01:45.973
Go on!

02:01:47.441 --> 02:01:48.463
Uncle!

02:01:52.249 --> 02:01:54.478
Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

02:01:55.128 --> 02:01:56.149
What is your name?

02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:57.949
Don't ask like that, Kaustubh!

02:02:00.398 --> 02:02:01.476
My name is Deva!

02:02:01.556 --> 02:02:03.770
So you are Deva!
- Yes, its me.

02:02:04.832 --> 02:02:07.386
I am scared of my father.

02:02:09.178 --> 02:02:11.651
And my father is scared of you.

02:02:12.526 --> 02:02:15.056
Can you make anyone scared?

02:02:15.989 --> 02:02:17.870
Yes, I can do that.
- Promise?

02:02:19.458 --> 02:02:20.707
Promise!

02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:22.636
Tell me who we should scare.

02:02:23.252 --> 02:02:26.706
There is a scary man inside me.

02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:28.798
He is not coming outside.

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.555
Father is also scared.

02:02:33.273 --> 02:02:35.706
That is why they cut my hair.

02:02:37.157 --> 02:02:39.727
Is there any solution for this?

02:02:41.553 --> 02:02:43.077
I get pain also sometimes.

02:02:43.758 --> 02:02:48.747
Because of this, there is no school.

02:02:49.026 --> 02:02:50.570
I don't go to play.

02:02:50.650 --> 02:02:52.989
Can you scare this insider away?

02:02:54.682 --> 02:02:55.714
What is this?

02:02:56.783 --> 02:02:57.892
Nothing, bro!

02:02:58.866 --> 02:03:00.546
What actually happened?
What is the problem?

02:03:01.318 --> 02:03:02.777
We came to know only last month.

02:03:03.614 --> 02:03:07.753
From when he was born,
they were more white blood cells...

02:03:08.045 --> 02:03:10.789
Some condition called leukaemia...

02:03:10.869 --> 02:03:12.216
Rajan?!
- It is cancer.

02:03:12.754 --> 02:03:15.919
We tried chemotherapy etc,
but his body could not handle it.

02:03:21.373 --> 02:03:23.053
Why you did not tell me till now?

02:03:23.896 --> 02:03:25.848
We could tell you
about small problems.

02:03:26.672 --> 02:03:28.021
This is something beyond our reach.

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:30.246
Please forget it, bro.

02:03:31.231 --> 02:03:34.312
He should be happy
so long as he lives.

02:03:34.662 --> 02:03:37.088
That's why this
birthday party and all.

02:03:39.185 --> 02:03:40.813
Can you scare him away?

02:03:41.656 --> 02:03:42.882
Promise?!

02:04:04.405 --> 02:04:06.051
Deva! Deva!

02:04:07.032 --> 02:04:09.400
Rajan, bring the best doctors.

02:04:09.902 --> 02:04:12.367
I don't know if you will
request okay threaten them.

02:04:13.438 --> 02:04:15.173
The boy should live.

02:04:19.506 --> 02:04:20.969
Take it sir.

02:04:21.049 --> 02:04:23.760
We should bring many things.

02:04:25.596 --> 02:04:27.166
There seems to be a lot of activity.

02:04:27.246 --> 02:04:28.968
No one will come here, sir.

02:04:29.048 --> 02:04:30.916
The chairman should have
given him some other useful task.

02:04:31.952 --> 02:04:33.525
For now we will manage with this.

02:04:36.070 --> 02:04:37.773
Please take care of the anaesthesia.

02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:46.173
How many online
applications did we receive?

02:04:46.416 --> 02:04:47.819
Received 6 till now, sir.

02:04:52.983 --> 02:04:54.118
We have to do something.

02:04:54.198 --> 02:04:55.669
Sir, sir.

02:04:57.726 --> 02:05:00.919
There is an organ donation camp.
- No! Not interested.

02:05:29.884 --> 02:05:33.265
I am sorry. I got delayed
because of Chintu School.

02:05:34.311 --> 02:05:36.395
Family is the first
one to support you.

02:05:37.936 --> 02:05:39.282
Where is the form for me?

02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:43.895
What about me?

02:05:44.041 --> 02:05:45.354
I will feel for you, come this side.

02:05:47.745 --> 02:05:49.464
Dasu! Dasu!

02:05:57.217 --> 02:05:59.008
We gave a lot of time
since morning. - Sir!

02:05:59.592 --> 02:06:01.092
Tell him to remove it.
- I will do that, sir.

02:06:01.172 --> 02:06:03.484
Remove all these dropdowns
and put a LED screen there.

02:06:03.564 --> 02:06:05.228
That empty space over there,
- Okay, sir.

02:06:05.308 --> 02:06:06.688
fill it up with chairs.

02:06:06.768 --> 02:06:08.460
Please remove all these.
- What is happening here?

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:10.810
Have a seminar to conduct
so you have to vacate.

02:06:10.972 --> 02:06:12.432
We were given time till 8.

02:06:12.959 --> 02:06:14.062
Leave it, sir.

02:06:14.142 --> 02:06:16.827
Because we will have some
dignitaries, keep this area clean.

02:06:17.007 --> 02:06:19.107
Stop there, I am telling you.

02:06:19.488 --> 02:06:20.826
I am asking you to stop!

02:06:22.278 --> 02:06:23.567
Who is Das here?

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.086
Take this!

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:29.681
What is that?!

02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:33.444
Please be careful.

02:06:54.493 --> 02:06:56.713
There will be at least 10,000, sir!

02:07:04.973 --> 02:07:07.457
Hello, doctor!
Hope you received the forms.

02:07:08.197 --> 02:07:11.450
We know only to kill
but not to give life like you.

02:07:11.845 --> 02:07:13.741
We will not live long anyway.

02:07:14.187 --> 02:07:15.818
So you will get the organs quickly.

02:07:49.073 --> 02:07:51.759
Sir, the donation camp
of Dr Das became a huge success.

02:07:51.839 --> 02:07:53.206
We received almost 10,000 forms.

02:07:53.286 --> 02:07:55.111
What you said about Das is true.

02:07:57.871 --> 02:07:59.959
Dr how is he?

02:08:00.172 --> 02:08:02.148
It is 3 hours since surgery.

02:08:03.071 --> 02:08:05.027
An expert team of 8
members operated on him.

02:08:05.107 --> 02:08:06.993
It is very critical in such cases.

02:08:07.186 --> 02:08:10.297
The immune system is very
weak because of his young age.

02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:11.960
It's not in our hands.

02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:13.152
What do you mean
it's not in our hands?

02:08:13.608 --> 02:08:15.302
You are senior doctors.
Do something!

02:08:15.382 --> 02:08:17.272
Sometimes, whatever we do...

02:08:17.352 --> 02:08:18.765
I don't care about all this.

02:08:18.845 --> 02:08:19.949
The boys should live!

02:08:20.029 --> 02:08:22.001
Somethings are not in
your control or our control.

02:08:22.081 --> 02:08:24.206
We have to accept it.
Please try to understand!

02:08:34.245 --> 02:08:36.580
Will you scare the demon away?

02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:37.991
Promise?!

02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:11.099
'It is a life, Deva.'

02:09:12.704 --> 02:09:14.910
'I had a small hope that
you would change someday.'

02:09:15.899 --> 02:09:18.258
'What is why I requested
you to escape and surrender.'

02:09:18.477 --> 02:09:20.253
'You are the person living in fear!'

02:09:27.739 --> 02:09:30.100
What happened to you?
You don't pick the phone or answer.

02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:31.521
Tomorrow I am coming
to the TV studio.

02:09:31.838 --> 02:09:32.941
Arrange for a live broadcast.

02:09:33.021 --> 02:09:35.088
Live?!
- I have to speak about Deva!

02:09:36.042 --> 02:09:37.080
Okay.

02:09:42.348 --> 02:09:43.493
What the hell is happening?

02:09:43.899 --> 02:09:45.703
Let's stop this
Undercover nonsense now!

02:09:46.494 --> 02:09:47.690
I want that Das.

02:09:48.309 --> 02:09:50.285
Arrest him and bring right now!

02:09:50.663 --> 02:09:52.090
Sir, he will not tell
anything about Deva.

02:09:52.398 --> 02:09:53.565
I know about Das very well.

02:09:53.736 --> 02:09:57.052
I know! I know that
you know Das very well.

02:09:58.138 --> 02:09:59.605
Sir...
- I want that Das.

02:09:59.685 --> 02:10:01.243
10 minutes is what you have!

02:10:01.397 --> 02:10:02.557
It's an order.

02:10:05.792 --> 02:10:06.992
'Why he did not come till now?'

02:10:25.073 --> 02:10:26.395
He is not to be seen anywhere.

02:10:26.475 --> 02:10:27.919
He said that he is waiting outside.

02:10:28.708 --> 02:10:31.364
Why did you put your hands forward?
Last time you put them back side.

02:10:38.561 --> 02:10:40.403
Will you not change at all?!

02:10:41.058 --> 02:10:42.129
If you kidnap once,
I will be scared.

02:10:42.209 --> 02:10:44.770
If you do that again and again,
I will get irritated.

02:10:45.399 --> 02:10:47.274
Where is the boss? I know that
you are hiding behind some door.

02:10:47.354 --> 02:10:48.525
You may come out now.

02:10:49.654 --> 02:10:51.671
Hello, now there is something...

02:10:54.188 --> 02:10:55.486
I thought that Deva would come.
Who is this person?

02:10:55.739 --> 02:10:56.758
David!

02:10:56.906 --> 02:10:58.761
David! Some new
character in the script?

02:10:59.202 --> 02:11:00.240
Where is Deva?

02:11:00.901 --> 02:11:02.101
Is he Dr Das?

02:11:02.452 --> 02:11:04.748
Yes I am Dr Das...
MBBS, MS, gold medalist.

02:11:04.828 --> 02:11:07.167
I am the person who owns
the clinic as well as the mall.

02:11:07.247 --> 02:11:11.110
You will offer me some cash and
apartment, and tell me to kill Deva!

02:11:11.279 --> 02:11:12.310
Don't irritate me!

02:11:12.914 --> 02:11:16.099
Where is Deva?
- David, Deva is on the TV.

02:11:17.234 --> 02:11:18.531
'Very good morning, everyone!'

02:11:19.051 --> 02:11:20.322
'Welcome to our live telecast.'

02:11:20.402 --> 02:11:22.429
'We don't know how he
looks and where he lives.'

02:11:22.721 --> 02:11:25.978
'He lives in the dark and
terrorizes the entire nation.'

02:11:26.185 --> 02:11:29.468
'India's most wanted
Mafia Don! Deva!'

02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:35.935
'To reveal information about
him we have a senior CBI officer.'

02:11:36.369 --> 02:11:38.354
Welcome Mr Vikram Kumar.
Please carry on!

02:11:38.721 --> 02:11:42.542
Thank you!
I never spoke before in public.

02:11:43.078 --> 02:11:44.862
I did not speak when
so many are watching.

02:11:45.258 --> 02:11:48.896
'I don't know if I can say
properly what I want to say.'

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.379
Mr Vikram, there is no urgency.

02:11:51.805 --> 02:11:53.102
Be comfortable!

02:11:56.052 --> 02:11:59.274
My name is not Vikram Kumar
and I am not a CBI officer.

02:11:59.681 --> 02:12:03.106
'Did not come here
to speak about Deva.'

02:12:06.482 --> 02:12:08.022
'I am Deva!'

02:12:15.970 --> 02:12:18.379
What is this, sir?
This is a live show!

02:12:18.459 --> 02:12:20.875
Millions are watching this!
Please speak carefully.

02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:25.585
Vikram, please don't shoot!

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:29.940
It's live!
- Vikram Kumar is a cheat.

02:12:31.018 --> 02:12:32.664
Deva is the truth!

02:12:34.699 --> 02:12:36.628
'Till now Deva lived
with arrogance.'

02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:40.082
'He thought that money
and power is everything.'

02:12:43.114 --> 02:12:46.285
A 4 year-old boy...
He passed away look into my eyes.

02:12:47.614 --> 02:12:49.877
He asked me if I
could scare death away.

02:12:52.561 --> 02:12:56.404
Can this money and
power scare death?

02:12:58.626 --> 02:13:00.045
Can it give life to him?

02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:09.580
'Hey gold! You won!'

02:13:12.312 --> 02:13:14.267
'There is happiness in sharing'

02:13:15.799 --> 02:13:18.008
'with others than
with scaring others.'

02:13:20.396 --> 02:13:26.276
'There is joy in saving
one life then killing 10 lives.'

02:13:29.611 --> 02:13:33.807
You asked me if I could announce
my name even to one person.

02:13:35.236 --> 02:13:38.591
'That is why I came here to announce
my name before the entire world.'

02:13:41.581 --> 02:13:44.966
Jahnavi, he suddenly entered
my life, which was running fast.

02:13:46.832 --> 02:13:48.526
My life came following him.

02:13:49.151 --> 02:13:52.320
When he look into my eyes and talk,
I thought he is a kid.

02:13:53.156 --> 02:13:54.494
But I became a small boy.

02:13:54.875 --> 02:13:57.607
No one could manage me,
but he conquered me.

02:13:58.807 --> 02:14:00.713
I came here also because of him.

02:14:01.029 --> 02:14:02.780
He changed me with his goodness.

02:14:03.259 --> 02:14:06.430
Dr Das, MBBS MS gold medalist.

02:14:08.346 --> 02:14:11.095
'He is a real hero! He is gold!'

02:14:12.125 --> 02:14:13.487
Wait a minute!

02:14:20.635 --> 02:14:23.295
Bro, I am Das speaking...

02:14:25.605 --> 02:14:27.778
Deva, I am David.

02:14:29.121 --> 02:14:32.662
How can you surrender so easily?
Your Gold is with me.

02:14:33.486 --> 02:14:34.550
Come quickly!

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:41.795
It means you are not Deva's men?

02:14:49.643 --> 02:14:51.435
Move aside!

02:14:57.819 --> 02:14:58.934
Where did he escape?

02:14:59.014 --> 02:15:00.244
Let's go upstairs!

02:15:00.324 --> 02:15:01.386
Where is Deva?

02:15:05.278 --> 02:15:06.848
Deva will come for you?

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:10.142
There is a tablet for anxiety.
You should take that.

02:15:29.826 --> 02:15:30.951
Welcome, Deva! Welcome!

02:15:33.326 --> 02:15:34.454
Finally!

02:15:36.107 --> 02:15:39.504
How can you change without
settling our account?

02:15:39.658 --> 02:15:42.245
That is why I came.

02:15:44.409 --> 02:15:45.723
Let him go!

02:15:51.095 --> 02:15:54.701
You kill my brother
and smashed my business.

02:15:55.479 --> 02:16:00.571
If I just kill you,
my revenge won't be complete.

02:16:02.497 --> 02:16:05.980
David, it was like you.

02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:08.899
Killing, take revenge and all that.

02:16:09.224 --> 02:16:11.780
I did not know anything else.
All that is a waste.

02:16:13.038 --> 02:16:14.271
I have changed!

02:16:16.385 --> 02:16:17.910
It's all over.

02:16:24.391 --> 02:16:26.003
You also better change.

02:16:27.179 --> 02:16:29.064
Why should I change?

02:16:29.813 --> 02:16:31.374
I am not Deva.

02:16:31.454 --> 02:16:32.611
I am David!

02:16:33.524 --> 02:16:37.457
Till now I live in the hangover
of chanting my name Deva.

02:16:38.337 --> 02:16:39.969
Now my mind is clear.

02:16:41.337 --> 02:16:43.455
Now that you kidnapped him...

02:16:45.776 --> 02:16:47.489
Spend a few days with him.

02:16:48.301 --> 02:16:50.175
The Hangover of
David will come down.

02:16:50.427 --> 02:16:51.797
It's too late!

02:16:52.263 --> 02:16:54.919
Ravinder, shoot him!

02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:03.763
I am the principal
of the school you studied.

02:17:05.255 --> 02:17:06.966
You think I would go alone?

02:17:07.704 --> 02:17:09.658
I will take every one of them.

02:17:10.615 --> 02:17:12.075
It is time for them to come.

02:17:16.865 --> 02:17:18.411
Fire!

02:17:22.287 --> 02:17:23.318
Pooja!

02:17:23.398 --> 02:17:24.862
Inspector Pooja!

02:17:25.199 --> 02:17:26.334
She is a police officer?

02:17:28.027 --> 02:17:29.071
Yes!

02:18:08.804 --> 02:18:10.175
Why did you deceive me?

02:18:10.353 --> 02:18:12.477
I did not deceive you.
I did my duty.

02:18:12.793 --> 02:18:14.391
But our love is a truth.

02:18:16.888 --> 02:18:20.382
I fell in love with one girl and she
turned out to be a police officer.

02:18:22.004 --> 02:18:23.537
I am a doctor, what did I do?

02:18:41.433 --> 02:18:42.714
Deva!

02:20:02.857 --> 02:20:04.310
Deva!

02:20:18.475 --> 02:20:19.708
Deva!

02:20:22.179 --> 02:20:23.993
There is a gun over there.

02:20:30.033 --> 02:20:32.101
Deva!

02:20:32.922 --> 02:20:35.405
Pickup the gun and shoot him!

02:20:39.926 --> 02:20:41.517
Deva!

02:21:10.494 --> 02:21:12.075
Deva!

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.610
Dasu, the bullet hit me.

02:21:16.129 --> 02:21:18.075
Nothing will happen to you.

02:21:19.453 --> 02:21:20.880
You will come to no harm, Deva.

02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:24.999
Nothing will happen to you.

02:21:28.025 --> 02:21:30.173
Deva!

02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:39.348
Vitals are coming down.

02:21:39.428 --> 02:21:41.571
I think it's very difficult.

02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:57.900
When the bullet team and it you,

02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:02.451
I was afraid.

02:22:03.048 --> 02:22:06.929
Now I feel like crying.

02:22:13.018 --> 02:22:14.842
I wanted you to change,
but you changed me.

02:22:15.963 --> 02:22:17.333
This is the mistake you made.

02:22:18.541 --> 02:22:19.943
It is a mistake to challenge death.

02:22:21.711 --> 02:22:23.333
Is a greater mistake
to die than to kill.

02:22:25.506 --> 02:22:26.917
I don't have anyone, Deva.

02:22:31.134 --> 02:22:32.277
You are the only one.

02:22:33.363 --> 02:22:35.373
I cannot imagine life without you.

02:22:35.705 --> 02:22:38.154
I learnt from you how to live.

02:22:39.638 --> 02:22:41.348
Till you come to my life,
I did not know anything.

02:22:43.674 --> 02:22:46.860
I did not know how
much soda to add to a peg.

02:22:49.017 --> 02:22:51.975
I never knew how many
bullets are there in a pistol.

02:22:52.055 --> 02:22:53.744
Deva.

02:22:54.741 --> 02:22:56.371
Deva.

02:23:02.493 --> 02:23:05.631
Gold, now you know everything.

02:23:07.797 --> 02:23:09.369
You should not speak, Deva.

02:23:11.047 --> 02:23:14.225
Someone said that I
would die a dastardly death.

02:23:14.712 --> 02:23:16.739
And that no one would
be there to cry by my side.

02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:19.212
Now the same person
is crying for me.

02:23:19.292 --> 02:23:20.420
You should not say anything.

02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:22.852
Nothing will happen to you.

02:23:22.932 --> 02:23:27.108
I want to drink
one last peg with you.

02:23:28.088 --> 02:23:29.410
What do you mean one last time?

02:23:30.107 --> 02:23:32.199
We have to spend
a lot of time together.

02:23:32.418 --> 02:23:35.142
We have to room together
and eat your favourite fish fry.

02:23:38.442 --> 02:23:40.040
You should keep smiling
like this always.

02:23:41.077 --> 02:23:43.055
Only then life will be beautiful.

02:23:45.342 --> 02:23:47.037
Now I can die peacefully!

02:23:51.715 --> 02:23:52.745
Deva!

02:23:53.499 --> 02:23:54.708
Deva!

02:24:02.492 --> 02:24:05.905
'Deva got injured in the
shootout between Mafia and police.'

02:24:07.697 --> 02:24:11.541
'Doctors determined that
he died while getting treatment.'

02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:18.846
'With this operation
Deva is closed.'

02:24:28.022 --> 02:24:32.623
"My heart has gone somewhere."

02:24:34.124 --> 02:24:38.563
"I became alone."

02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:47.525
"O cold breeze, get me the details."

02:24:48.273 --> 02:24:50.746
"Find out what happened."

02:24:59.556 --> 02:25:01.567
You must only act simply.

02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:04.642
Don't do over action.

02:25:08.333 --> 02:25:09.691
I will set up everything outside.

02:25:13.302 --> 02:25:14.535
Good night!

02:25:15.816 --> 02:25:17.430
Mr Kuchipudi! Is everything ready?

02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:20.438
Because of a bullet injury,
the left heart artery was affected.

02:25:20.518 --> 02:25:22.724
Right.
- Supervision.

02:25:23.585 --> 02:25:25.417
The right heart artery
was severely damaged.

02:25:25.597 --> 02:25:28.600
Within few minutes after
the operation, Deva died.

02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:30.344
His body was shifted
to the mortuary.

02:25:30.424 --> 02:25:31.634
Mortuary is ready
and the body is ready.

02:25:31.714 --> 02:25:34.027
Mr Murthy is ready to do
the postmortem. Are you ready?

02:25:34.341 --> 02:25:36.486
Is the police waiting downstairs?
- I thought you are afraid!

02:25:36.745 --> 02:25:38.153
Finish the work quickly!

02:25:44.036 --> 02:25:45.353
I have to sign, isn't it?

02:25:48.713 --> 02:25:50.740
He is the one behind
organ donation, right?

02:25:54.836 --> 02:25:57.658
Fill it up properly and I will sign.

02:25:59.985 --> 02:26:01.193
Take him.

02:26:03.358 --> 02:26:06.058
Dr Das, MBBS, MS, gold medalist.

02:26:06.626 --> 02:26:08.515
I think you must have light for
the first time in your profession.

02:26:08.595 --> 02:26:11.474
I did not lie. Deva really died.

02:26:11.778 --> 02:26:13.254
Human being inside Deva is alive.

02:26:14.268 --> 02:26:16.519
It would be good if we have a doctor

02:26:16.599 --> 02:26:18.403
who gives life to the
human being inside us.

02:26:20.081 --> 02:26:21.427
Like you!

02:26:26.991 --> 02:26:28.132
Where are we going next?

02:26:28.212 --> 02:26:29.676
Up to you, gold!

02:26:30.344 --> 02:26:31.881
The world is ours!

02:26:33.074 --> 02:26:35.661
You can decide, Pooja!
Come here.
