00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:10.625
This film is dedicated to you.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.666
While death awaits to engulf us,

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.541
the rays of moonlight that touched you
questioned me, "Where is the sun?"

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.875
I told them that you reside
in the memory of this ever-flowing river.

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:11.541
SHYAM SINGHA ROY

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.000
-Bro?
-Bro, the cafe owner is pestering me

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:54.333
to wrap up the shoot.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:57.083
Please talk to him.
I can't take this torture anymore.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.541
Don't worry. He just likes to bluster.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.583
Just chill. I'll take care of it.

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:05.208
-How many girls are coming today?
-There are five girls here today.

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:08.416
Okay. Get everything ready.
I'll be right there.

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:31.125
AAKALI RAJYAM

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:32.500
IRUVAR

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:38.833
-Good morning.
-Morning, bro.

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:42.583
-Everyone is here? All set?
-Yes, we are ready.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.166
-Do they have the script?
-Yes.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.166
-Have you explained the scene?
-Yes, I've explained.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.250
Everyone had coffee as well.

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.541
Thank you for reminding.
Get me some black coffee.

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.875
What are you looking at?
Go and get me some coffee.

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.375
-Get into position.
-Yeah, bro.

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:05.041
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?
Don't you have any work to do?

00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:07.625
I've been promised a role in the film.

00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.750
Oh, is it? So that's why you have
groomed yourself like a hero?

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:15.000
You fool! They will put you far away
in the background somewhere.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.833
You'll regret if you take
a filmmaker's words for granted.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:19.166
Go and get some black coffee.

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:21.541
Leave this here.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:28.791
If you take two months to complete
the auditions for a short film,

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:31.208
how long would you take
to complete a feature film?

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:33.958
Whatever we do, it must be perfect.

00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:35.750
-You're right.
-Pan it to the right.

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:38.500
This is not perfection.
This is called obsession.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.875
By the time you become a director,
you'll surely make me close down my cafe.

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.875
Then, I'll have to open a small tea shop
near a film studio.

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.500
-That is your plan, right?
-Bro.

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:50.541
More than a 100 people
have come to your cafe for auditions.

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.916
We are promoting your brand for free.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.833
What is the name of my cafe?

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:55.791
Coffin!

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.666
Coffin? What the heck?

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.833
It's Coffee Inn!

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:00.291
-Coffee. Inn.
-Okay.

00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.250
-Coffin is a box for burying a corpse.
-Okay.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.625
-Okay. Ready. Ask them to come.
-Yes, bro.

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:09.333
Hello.

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:10.416
-Did you read the script?
-Yes.

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:12.000
-Any doubts?
-No.

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:13.291
Ready. Start camera.

00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:15.791
Rolling, bro.

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:16.791
Action!

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:18.500
I am a woman.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:21.583
A lady with progressive views
in this developing country.

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:23.750
A person draped in a saree of revolution

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:26.083
to drive away the darkness of fear.

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:31.083
The dialogue is correct.
Now, will you please act it out?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.833
I did act it out.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.458
It's very bland. There's no feeling in it.

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:40.291
Don't mug up the dialogues.
Keep them in your subconscious mind.

00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:42.000
Action!

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:43.500
I am a woman.

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:47.375
A lady with progressive views
in this developing country.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
A beautiful person draped
in a saree of revolution

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.916
to drive away the darkness of fear.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.791
Have you worked as a news anchor?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.750
Yes. How do you know?

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:01.375
We have seen you on TV.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:06.916
I am a beautiful girl.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.708
A girl from a developing country...

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:11.041
That is not the dialogue!

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.500
Read it once again,
and deliver it correctly. Okay?

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:20.166
Actually,
I have worked in many short films.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.250
Also, I was a TikTok star
prior to its ban.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:25.583
I have never auditioned before.
I can directly come to the shoot.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:28.291
Is this necessary?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.625
You are more focused on your make-up
than your performance.

00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:34.500
You may leave now.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:35.666
I am a woman.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:40.500
A lady with progressive views
in this developing country.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.125
A beautiful person draped
in a saree of revolution

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.166
to drive away the darkness of fear.

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.166
Good. I like it.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:52.125
Give me some time.
My team will contact you soon.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.500
Hey, that girl is good.
Why don't you cast her?

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.333
She is good, but she isn't the perfect fit
for the character.

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:02.375
-She is too cliche.
-This is too much.

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:05.041
She's fair-skinned and tall.

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.708
Her dialogue delivery is good.
What else do you want?

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:09.708
To become an actor or actress,

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:13.791
it's not necessary
that one must be fair or tall.

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:14.791
Then?

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:18.708
Body movements. Fine speech.

00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:20.291
Purity. Fine expression.

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:22.125
What do you mean by expression?

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.416
Body language.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:39.833
Yeah, yesterday's party was crazy,
but I left early.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:41.916
Oh yeah! You know what happened?

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:44.500
Yesterday, when we were going back home...

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:53.125
That's the body language.

00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:03.125
Hey.

00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:06.166
So, exactly after she said that,
we laughed about it.

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:15.291
Yeah.

00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.833
Good body movements.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.416
The music was great, right?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.833
No, no. She is a drama queen.

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:24.750
Yeah. Later, she started crying
in the cab.

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:27.833
You should have seen the face
of the cab driver. Oh, my God!

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:29.750
He was literally pleading with her.

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:31.125
He was so frightened.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.083
Fine speech.

00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:37.125
-Hey, bro!
-Hey!

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.208
-Sorry, ma'am.
-Please be careful.

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:41.291
-Relax. Chill.
-Sorry, ma'am.

00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:43.458
Don't panic. Here you go.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.750
-Okay?
-Sorry, ma'am.

00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:46.708
That's okay.

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:51.708
Purity.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.875
Oh! Okay.

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.250
I got to go.
I'll catch up with you guys later.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.250
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:11.625
She's my female lead.

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:14.750
Excuse me.

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:17.916
Hi! Can I have a word with you?
I'm Vasu, a film director.

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:19.666
-Director?
-Yeah.

00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:21.166
What movies have you directed?

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:23.958
Tell her.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.583
Upcoming director.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.333
I'm directing a short film now.

00:09:28.416 --> 00:09:30.750
If it's successful,
I'll be offered a movie.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.458
Okay.

00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:34.833
Nice, I guess. Good luck.

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:37.666
I think it will be great
if you could act in my film.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.416
Oh! Thanks.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.583
But me? Acting in a film?

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.791
No way. I'm not interested.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:44.916
Sorry.

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:47.500
You'll become interested
once you start working.

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.958
I've been holding
the auditions for two months.

00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:52.458
You are exactly as I imagined
that character.

00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:54.083
No... You don't understand.

00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:57.250
I'm not at all interested,
so let's leave it here. Okay?

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:58.666
I need to go. Bye.

00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:02.666
She is not interested.

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.208
-Talk to her.
-Hello!

00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.416
It's really hard to find
a Telugu-speaking heroine.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.666
Please accept the role.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.750
You can get free coffee here.
This is my cafe.

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:13.625
Bro, relax.

00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.458
First of all, I don't like movies.
I don't even watch them.

00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:18.458
Exactly.

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:21.208
My heroine is also not interested
in movies.

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:23.333
Her physical appearance
is similar to yours.

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:26.333
Big eyes, arrogant attitude,
and average looks.

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:29.125
What the hell!

00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:32.291
-I mean...
-I'm not interested, and I'm not doing it.

00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.416
-Say something, man.
-That's it!

00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:37.500
Listen...

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.666
Come on, man!

00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.625
I need to take care of my cafe.

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.250
Then I'll continue the auditions
at your place.

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.666
Let's go and persuade her.

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:06.666
Hey, what the hell!

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.625
What do you think of yourselves?
Don't you get it?

00:11:09.708 --> 00:11:12.125
You followed me to my house.
Are you crazy?

00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:14.125
This is too much, man. How dare you?

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.041
Hey... Relax.

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.708
This is not right. I understand.

00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:20.583
We've come here
because we're serious about casting you.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:22.708
We are working hard. Please don't refuse.

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:25.083
What is this ruckus? Who are they?

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.750
Dad, they have followed me
all the way from a cafe.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:30.208
He is trying to persuade me
despite my rejection.

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:31.333
I'll call the she-team.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.666
Hey...

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:36.875
You look like a decent guy.
What do you do?

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:38.666
Film director.

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:41.333
Film director? What movies have you made?

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:44.916
It's okay.

00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:46.875
Upcoming director.

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.625
Oh! But I don't want to marry
my daughter off to a movie man.

00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:52.500
Sorry, you can find someone else.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.666
I know, people don't even want to rent out
their houses to movie people.

00:11:56.791 --> 00:11:58.416
-Your daughter...
-Name is Keerti.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.458
I'm asking Keerti to act in my short film.

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:02.875
Short film?
Will you release it on YouTube?

00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.291
-I just want to show it to a producer...
-It'll be on YouTube.

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:10.000
-Your daughter can be part of it.
-Is it? What other films has he made?

00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:11.875
-To file a harassment complaint...
-What the hell.

00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.250
Ms. Keerti, listen to me.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.708
Your dad has approved.
Now you must agree to it.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:19.375
Why should I?

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.041
This is my last option.
I don't have any other choice.

00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:27.750
If you don't agree,
I'll tell your dad that you smoke.

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:29.166
What the hell?

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.375
My dad won't believe you.

00:12:37.916 --> 00:12:39.125
Are you for real?

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:41.791
Please, Keerti. I'll delete it.

00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:44.416
Please understand my desperation.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.541
I'm really sorry for troubling you.
This is really important for me.

00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:50.250
This short film is very crucial
to my career.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:53.375
And I can't afford to hire
professional actors.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.208
Films have been my passion
since childhood.

00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:01.041
My budget is low.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.708
I've resigned my software job as well.

00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.583
Please understand.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.666
But I don't know how to act.

00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:09.833
Acting is nothing but reacting.

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:11.625
Your reactions are naturally good.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.416
You are a natural star.

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:15.791
It's just a short film, dear.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:17.958
Everyone is making them these days.

00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:21.000
Our neighbor uploads all her recipes
on YouTube.

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:23.000
I secretly follow her channel.

00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:24.666
Is he stalking that lady?

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.208
I get to see you on screen
when you're away.

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:28.583
Please accept.

00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.291
Okay, I'll do it. But I'll leave Hyderabad
in two weeks.

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.041
-I'm going to Mumbai for higher studies.
-All the best.

00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:37.625
She is pursuing
her master's in psychology.

00:13:37.708 --> 00:13:39.708
Is that why she behaves like a psycho?

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:44.625
So I can give you only two weeks.
I've even booked my flight tickets.

00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:45.833
Two weeks is more than enough.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:47.083
And one more thing.

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:49.708
If anything troubles me during the shoot,

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.083
-I'll immediately opt out of it.
-No...

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:56.375
Don't worry. We'll take great care of you.
You'll not be troubled in the slightest.

00:13:57.541 --> 00:13:58.500
And...

00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:00.416
What about that photo?

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.583
Deleted. Deleted.

00:14:06.083 --> 00:14:07.583
I'll pick you up at 6 am.

00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:08.666
What photo is that?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.083
Photo... Selfie!

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:13.041
Uncle, let's take a selfie. Please.

00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:23.291
Hello.

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:24.541
Good morning, Heroine.

00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:26.666
Are you ready? I'm waiting at your gate.

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:29.041
What?

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.625
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:39.458
Oh, my God!

00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:52.416
Do you have a make-up artist?

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:54.041
Where is the make-up artist?

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.208
What make-up artist?

00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:56.416
That guy...

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:58.041
Oh! He died of CoVID 19.

00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:01.250
Please do your own make-up.

00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:03.541
Make-up is set.

00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:07.833
The story is...

00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:11.666
She loves to paint from childhood.
Canvas is her world.

00:15:12.708 --> 00:15:14.250
But her painting lacks soul.

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.083
She searches for a color in every emotion.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.666
All of a sudden,
she finds a blank paper one day.

00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:27.541
On the screen

00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:32.125
A picture moves

00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:38.166
Begins a story

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.458
A star has descended from the sky

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:47.458
Walking on the earth

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:48.666
This take is okay.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.041
An angry young damsel

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.583
Portrays a myriad of characters

00:15:56.666 --> 00:16:00.791
The sight of which mesmerizes you

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:05.083
And everything goes up in smoke in a flash

00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.000
Isn't it enchanting?

00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:13.583
It's beyond what the human eye can capture

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:17.625
See the world through this lens

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.750
It'll show everything with greater clarity

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:22.916
Its light reveals
what's concealed in the shadows

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.291
Although the work proves difficult,
Strangely, one would begin to love it

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:29.958
Continue... Okay.

00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:49.875
Nice. You are doing great.

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:52.625
Shall we go for the next scene?
Change your costume.

00:16:52.708 --> 00:16:53.791
Ready.

00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:00.291
Hey, where shall I change my dress?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.958
Well, you can use my car.

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:10.041
I'll cover the car with a black cloth.

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:11.208
What the hell?

00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:14.333
I don't even use
the fitting rooms at a clothes store.

00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:17.291
And you are asking me to change
my dress on a highway? Impossible!

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:20.583
Keerti, films have been my passion
since childhood.

00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:23.208
My budget is low.
I've even resigned my job.

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.333
Please understand.

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:29.916
What are you looking at?

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.416
Bro, it's about to rain.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.750
Good. We can use the rain effect for free.
It costs a lot to artificially create one.

00:17:41.833 --> 00:17:43.416
Will the actress agree to it?

00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:46.000
Okay. Rolling!

00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:49.458
Action!

00:17:50.875 --> 00:17:52.416
Oh, shit.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.125
Keerti... Keep walking...

00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:56.291
Be in the mood!

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.583
Slowly look at the sky
and cry your heart out.

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:05.416
More. More.

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:09.875
Cut!

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.791
Nice.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.708
One more!

00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:26.375
The house looks great.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.666
-Keep it in top angle. A nice shot.
-Okay.

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.625
Tell them to turn those lights off.

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:34.791
It's the police.

00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:41.208
Are you shooting a film?
Do you have a permit?

00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:44.083
-It's just a short film, sir.
-It doesn't matter.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.000
We have received a complaint from the MP.

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:49.291
What's his problem with us?

00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:51.625
He saw a drone flying around his house.

00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:54.125
Come to the station.

00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:56.625
You can take us, but leave the girl alone.

00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:00.333
Oh! She is with you!

00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:02.625
I thought she was related to the MP.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:03.666
-Bhadram.
-Sir.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.708
-Get her into the car.
-Okay, sir.

00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:06.791
And then what?

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.416
Don't take my cap.

00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:26.375
Sorry, sir.
I'll make sure this never happens again.

00:19:30.458 --> 00:19:32.083
Keerti! Keerti...

00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:34.750
Why should I put up
with a crazy movie guy?

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:36.541
I am a graduate in psychology.

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:39.958
Why should I get myself detained
at police stations because of you?

00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:41.958
-Just go to hell.
-Okay.

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:44.041
Okay.

00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:48.000
I've skipped this month's rent
to pay for the shoot.

00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:51.791
I don't have enough budget
to hire a new actress.

00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:55.291
It will stall the shooting of my film.

00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:58.166
So be it!

00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:01.166
So be it. It's all right.

00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:05.708
Films have been my passion
since childhood.

00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:08.333
My budget is low.
I've resigned my job as well.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.000
-Please, understand. This short film--
-I understand.

00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:12.916
Your career requires me to suffer.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.125
Stop your theatrics. I'll do it.

00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:17.416
Thank you, Keerti!

00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:18.750
Thank you, uncle.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.791
Thank god she's agreed to work
with me again.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.500
Thank you. Come, let's go.

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:27.375
Such an idiot.

00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:36.541
A dream never dies

00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:40.666
Yet turning it into a reality
is no small matter

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:43.000
Face the hardships

00:20:43.083 --> 00:20:45.000
Take your time

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:49.083
But never give up
Your dream will surely be realized one day

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:53.208
There are only two colors
Sunlight converts them into seven

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:57.333
Paint your dream colorfully
Let it reach the silver screen

00:20:57.416 --> 00:21:01.875
The destination may be far away
But I'm going to reach it anyway

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.500
See the world through this lens
It'll show everything with greater clarity

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:09.958
Its light reveals
what's concealed in the shadows

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.750
Although the work proves difficult,

00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:19.291
Strangely, one would begin to love it

00:21:34.791 --> 00:21:37.541
-Tomorrow is the last day of the shoot.
-Yeah, bye.

00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:38.458
Bye.

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:49.666
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:59.000
-Hi, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:01.166
We've been waiting to take
a selfie with you.

00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:02.625
Why?

00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:04.541
Aren't you the heroine of this film?

00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:05.625
Yes, I am.

00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.583
Keshav, go back two steps.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:14.083
-Don't be shy. Come closer.
-All right.

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.291
Hey, stop it!

00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:38.125
-Bro...
-One second.

00:22:38.666 --> 00:22:40.958
Wait for two counts, then
immediately take camera favor.

00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:43.708
What are you doing?
Don't you have manners?

00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:47.208
-Do you think I'm--
-Do you want us to buy a ticket for this?

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.083
Bro.

00:22:49.625 --> 00:22:50.791
How dare you touch me?

00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:53.083
Hold this.

00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:22.000
Come, let's take a selfie.

00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:33.666
No...

00:24:47.791 --> 00:24:49.083
Vasu...

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.291
Vasu!

00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.875
What's happening? Who are these guys?

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.166
-Sachin, what happened here?
-Bro...

00:24:58.375 --> 00:24:59.916
You ear is bleeding.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.416
Are you okay?

00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:04.791
Hey, what's wrong?

00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:07.375
The tripod! It cost us Rs. 15,000.
How did it break?

00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:11.125
You acted like a hero and broke it.
First, let's get out of here.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.000
VARNAM

00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:33.083
-Congrats, Vasu.
-Sir.

00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:35.750
Well done! Nice!
You dealt with the subject maturely.

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:36.750
Thank you, sir.

00:25:36.833 --> 00:25:39.208
-We shall work together.
-Yes, sir.

00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:42.625
Get him to sign the agreement
and pay him an advance.

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:45.125
Meet me when you have
the bound script ready.

00:25:45.208 --> 00:25:46.583
I'll get it done within a month.

00:25:46.666 --> 00:25:48.416
-Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.583
-Sir.
-Vasu, I'll leave for the US tomorrow.

00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:11.458
When will I get the script?
I may not come back for two months.

00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:14.875
It's almost done, sir.
I'll give it to you tomorrow morning.

00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:17.833
Come to my office at 10 am.
I'm catching the afternoon flight.

00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:18.875
Okay, sir.

00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:34.166
TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE

00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:05.083
Amazing.

00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:06.708
It's a great script, Vasu.

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:11.958
The climax is just mind-blowing.
I can put money on this.

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:13.583
Thank you, sir.

00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:14.916
You are a very good writer.

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:18.625
You can start the project now.
I'll assign you a team.

00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:19.833
Thank you, sir.

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:23.750
Here you go.

00:28:25.125 --> 00:28:26.458
Let's wait a little longer.

00:28:26.958 --> 00:28:28.875
Wait for what? It'll lose the chillness.

00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:30.416
I'm waiting for Keerti.

00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:31.916
You carry on.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.291
Hi, Keerti.

00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:35.750
Wow!

00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:39.291
So excited to meet her?

00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:41.416
You...

00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:48.750
Hi, Keerti.

00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:51.125
Are you pulling my leg again?

00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:53.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:29:01.833 --> 00:29:02.958
Nice view.

00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:11.708
What is in that bag?
Did you bring some snacks?

00:29:12.166 --> 00:29:13.541
A small gift for you.

00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:16.125
For me? It's not really necessary.

00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:18.750
Congratulations.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.666
Thank you.

00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:22.833
I'm really happy for you.

00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:25.500
It's very nice.

00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:41.916
Your device is connected.

00:29:51.125 --> 00:29:55.625
Vasu, mention a special thanks to me
in the credits of your feature film.

00:29:55.708 --> 00:29:56.958
I'll be your lucky charm.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.041
Not just my name, but also add my photo.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.250
Photo is added if the person is dead.
Shall I do it?

00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:05.458
No need.

00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:11.208
You guys are unbelievable.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.791
I despised you guys in the beginning,
but now I'll miss you all.

00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:17.958
Please be in touch.

00:30:19.958 --> 00:30:21.458
You will leave for Mumbai.

00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:25.458
This guy will ignore us
once he starts working on his new film.

00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:27.333
I'll be all alone, selling coffee.

00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:28.750
Stop your theatrics.

00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:30.625
He will surely forget me.

00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:32.291
Do you think I'll forget you?

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.666
Impossible.

00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:36.750
In that case,
wear the shirt that I've just gifted you

00:30:36.833 --> 00:30:38.458
when you succeed as a director.

00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:40.916
Then I will believe
that you still remember me.

00:30:41.916 --> 00:30:42.833
Done.

00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:44.875
Okay. I'll leave.

00:30:45.541 --> 00:30:47.458
Hey, kid. Come, let's go.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.583
-Bye.
-See you. Bye. Nice.

00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:51.333
How long will you stay here?

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.458
I'll leave in another five minutes.

00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:54.458
Cool.

00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:56.833
Keerti, tell your friends
to keep visiting my cafe.

00:30:56.958 --> 00:30:59.083
-I'll give them a ten percent discount.
-Okay.

00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:01.041
-See you.
-Don't roam around, go home.

00:31:01.208 --> 00:31:02.083
To your home!

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:04.666
Okay. It's about to rain. Get inside.

00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:12.083
So?

00:31:13.208 --> 00:31:14.458
When will we meet again?

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.458
I don't know.

00:31:19.916 --> 00:31:20.750
Sorry.

00:31:21.958 --> 00:31:23.250
I didn't get you a gift.

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:38.791
Bye.

00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:55.000
Rosie.

00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:01.625
What the fuck!

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:05.083
-What happened?
-Who is Rosie?

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:07.958
I thought you were a gentleman.

00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:09.041
Such a pervert!

00:33:09.125 --> 00:33:10.166
Keerti, what's wrong?

00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:14.875
How can you think about another girl
when you are sharing a bed with me?

00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:16.166
You should be ashamed!

00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:20.041
This is the psychology of men.

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.708
You can never truly love one girl.

00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:24.583
You men are dogs.

00:33:24.666 --> 00:33:26.000
Keerti...

00:33:26.416 --> 00:33:27.458
I'm really sorry.

00:33:28.625 --> 00:33:29.625
Rosie?

00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:31.958
I don't know any Rosie.

00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:34.083
It's just a slip of the tongue.

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.666
Just shut up and get lost.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.875
It was stupid of me
to fall in love with you.

00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:43.833
This is so embarrassing.

00:33:44.666 --> 00:33:46.458
I never want to see your face again.

00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:56.500
Rosie?

00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:15.708
Who is Rosie?

00:34:15.791 --> 00:34:16.750
I don't know.

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:18.250
Tell me the truth.

00:34:18.708 --> 00:34:21.291
It's the truth.
I've never heard that name...

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.666
-Rosie.
-I've never heard it before.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.833
-Then why did you say call her Rosie?
-I don't know.

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:30.375
You must have picked that name
from some shitty Hollywood film.

00:34:30.458 --> 00:34:32.083
And you called her by that name.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.875
She won't take it easy.

00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:35.625
Shit!

00:34:35.708 --> 00:34:36.791
What do I do now?

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:40.791
After years of struggle, you've got
an opportunity to make a feature film.

00:34:40.916 --> 00:34:42.708
Concentrate on that.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.333
Finish the script and start the work.

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.333
You can meet plenty of women in your life.

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.083
Rolling!

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.125
Action!

00:35:19.708 --> 00:35:20.625
Silence!

00:35:33.875 --> 00:35:37.750
UNIKI

00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:45.208
Are you nervous?

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.000
That's a small word
to describe my feelings now.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.875
I don't even know how to describe it.

00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:55.708
It's a ten-year dream,
and one whole year of hard work.

00:35:58.541 --> 00:36:00.083
Bro, the show has just ended.

00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:12.541
Bro, how do you like the movie?

00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:14.583
It's great. I loved it. A blockbuster!

00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:17.458
The movie is a hit! Congratulations, dude!

00:36:17.916 --> 00:36:18.958
Congratulations.

00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:20.791
Bro, he is the director of this film.

00:36:21.125 --> 00:36:22.625
You are the director of the film!

00:36:22.708 --> 00:36:25.833
The movie is amazing. A blockbuster.
The climax was mind-blowing!

00:36:26.166 --> 00:36:27.958
Bro, can I take a selfie with you?

00:36:29.958 --> 00:36:31.500
Please, let me take a selfie.

00:36:31.583 --> 00:36:33.000
Okay, keep moving.

00:36:33.083 --> 00:36:34.083
Slowly.

00:36:35.416 --> 00:36:37.000
Please keep moving.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.208
Why are you crying like a baby?

00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:40.500
Your film is a hit.

00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.625
Vasu, I just got a call from Mumbai.

00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:52.125
Producer Vishal Chaturvedi
has seen our movie.

00:36:52.208 --> 00:36:53.833
He wants to remake it in Hindi.

00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:55.291
Wow!

00:36:55.375 --> 00:36:58.083
And they want you
to direct the Hindi version as well.

00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:01.791
-Are you serious? A Bollywood film?
-Bro, this is crazy!

00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:05.291
You are one lucky guy.
You will be reaching greater heights.

00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:07.416
Let's celebrate. Open the bottle!

00:37:15.291 --> 00:37:16.500
MUMBAI

00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:23.125
MUMBAI

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.625
KOLKATA

00:37:44.375 --> 00:37:45.500
Welcome to all of you.

00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:50.208
Well, I'm super excited and happy
to introduce a south Indian sensation,

00:37:50.333 --> 00:37:52.208
Mr. Vasudev, to the Hindi cinema.

00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:08.875
I must say that his last film
was a super-duper blockbuster hit.

00:38:09.208 --> 00:38:10.083
Uniki.

00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:11.875
UNIKI

00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:17.166
Well, we are about
to make it now in Hindi.

00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:20.333
Background?

00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:22.708
He has no godfather in the industry.
He is a nobody.

00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:25.416
I've got some more great news
to share with all of you.

00:38:27.458 --> 00:38:31.083
We're gonna be making two more
very high budget films with him.

00:38:56.708 --> 00:38:57.583
Mr. Vasudev?

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.375
We have an arrest warrant against you.
You have to come with us.

00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:03.541
Arrest warrant? What?

00:39:04.916 --> 00:39:06.375
Come on. Let's go.

00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:13.708
Well, this is a shocking news for us.

00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:16.250
Our company doesn't entertain
this kind of stuff.

00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.083
I'm calling this announcement off.

00:39:24.083 --> 00:39:28.083
In the old days, our directors gave
their blood and sweat to earn success.

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:31.333
He has tarnished our reputation in Mumbai.
What's his name?

00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:33.375
-Vasu.
-Yes, that's him.

00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:37.500
After I saw the film, it hit me
that I've read this story somewhere.

00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:40.458
HE COPIED FROM BENGALI,
AND NOT KOREAN OR HOLLYWOOD!

00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:42.458
What do you say about Vasu's arrest?

00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:44.916
I'm not responsible
for a director's plagiarism.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.958
I can't keep track of all the stories.
It is his fault.

00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:50.000
Our agreement with Vasu clearly states

00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:52.708
that he's responsible
for all the legal actions.

00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:54.916
The brain can generate
four kinds of waves.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.083
Delta, theta, alpha, and beta.

00:39:58.208 --> 00:39:59.875
And each of these states...

00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:01.375
Yes, Dad.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.000
Keerti, do you remember
that short-film director?

00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:06.250
He has been arrested.
Did you see the news?

00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:09.416
-You mean Vasu?
-Yes, it's Vasu.

00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:11.625
Why?

00:40:11.833 --> 00:40:14.625
He was arrested
on charges of copyright infringement.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.791
I'm sending you the news link.

00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:18.916
Okay. I'll call you back.

00:40:19.916 --> 00:40:21.541
DIRECTOR VASU ARRESTED DURING PRESS MEET

00:40:47.375 --> 00:40:50.291
Bro, please tell me if you know
any good lawyers.

00:40:50.916 --> 00:40:52.708
It's about the director who got arrested.

00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:55.375
Yes, he is my friend.

00:40:55.458 --> 00:40:58.833
No, he is a good guy.
He is framed by someone.

00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:03.083
Okay. Please let me know
if you find any good lawyers.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.666
Okay. Bye.

00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:19.958
She is Padmavati, my cousin.

00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:21.250
Oh.

00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:23.416
Nobody in my family likes her.

00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:25.416
We always fought each other.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.416
Then why did you bring me to her?

00:41:28.666 --> 00:41:30.833
She was a gold-medalist in college.

00:41:30.916 --> 00:41:32.583
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

00:41:32.666 --> 00:41:35.125
I need help with the drunk driving charges
against me.

00:41:35.208 --> 00:41:37.791
The breath analyzer showed 300 points.
Who drinks that much?

00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:39.791
Even if the judge lets you go, I won't.

00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:46.500
Hi, Paddu. How are you?

00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:47.916
I'm a bit irritated.

00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:50.125
How are your parents?

00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:53.166
I don't know.
I haven't met them in a long time.

00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:56.125
I have been meaning to meet you
for a long time.

00:41:56.208 --> 00:41:57.208
But I couldn't.

00:41:57.291 --> 00:42:01.375
I know that none of my relatives want to
meet me unless they need some legal help.

00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:02.583
What can I do for you?

00:42:03.166 --> 00:42:06.583
As I told you, it's about
my friend, Vasu, the film director.

00:42:06.708 --> 00:42:08.541
Oh! Yes. I saw it on the news.

00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:10.708
He was arrested during a press meet.

00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:13.541
He is your friend! So sad.

00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:16.291
Yes, ma'am. You must help him out.

00:42:17.416 --> 00:42:18.250
What do you do?

00:42:18.625 --> 00:42:20.625
I own a cafe.

00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:26.208
Do you provide a free service to
all your customers or do you charge them?

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:27.541
We charge them.

00:42:29.958 --> 00:42:30.875
I understand.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.916
Of course. Tell me how much you charge.
I will pay you.

00:42:34.208 --> 00:42:36.416
I will.
But first, I need to meet the accused.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.291
He is in the police station.
Let's go, please.

00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:42.708
You are right.
You shouldn't meet her often.

00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:55.916
Hi, Vasu. I am Padmavati, your lawyer.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.833
What's happening? Why did they arrest me?

00:42:59.666 --> 00:43:02.666
India's largest publication house,
SR Publishers, has lodged

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.083
a case of copyright infringement
against you.

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.666
They have alleged that your scripts
and the story of your film

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.166
have been plagiarized
from their Telugu and Bengali books.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.166
What?

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.583
Nonsense.

00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:18.666
I've studied your case.
I'll come to the point.

00:43:18.958 --> 00:43:22.458
If you plead guilty to your crime
without wasting the court's time,

00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:24.250
your punishment could be reduced.

00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:26.458
Since this is not a grave crime
like murder or rape,

00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:29.333
you can get away
with a mere six-month sentence

00:43:29.416 --> 00:43:31.125
or with just a fine, if you are lucky.

00:43:32.625 --> 00:43:33.750
I should plead guilty?

00:43:35.916 --> 00:43:37.291
Who told you that I'm guilty?

00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:43.458
I'm not apologizing to anyone.

00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:45.333
I did not plagiarize from any book.

00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:48.875
I wrote those stories.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.875
Two years ago, I registered them
with the Telugu Writers Association.

00:43:51.958 --> 00:43:53.000
I have proof.

00:44:00.166 --> 00:44:03.958
These books were published 50 years ago.
Your stories match theirs exactly.

00:44:04.666 --> 00:44:08.333
You didn't even have the sense
to change the names of the characters

00:44:08.416 --> 00:44:09.750
while copying from them.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.041
They are exactly the same.

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:15.875
Even a kid can tell
that you have copied from this book.

00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:23.291
Look, I'd lose my cool if you keep saying
that I copied someone's work.

00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:29.666
I've never read these books.
And I don't know Bengali either.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.291
One should never lie
to a doctor or lawyer.

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:33.833
I'm here to help you.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.958
Are you my lawyer or the opponent's?

00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:46.416
Why are you forcing me to plead guilty?

00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:50.625
I didn't plagiarize. Why don't you get it?

00:44:51.875 --> 00:44:53.708
Hey! Keep your voice down.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.250
It's not about me.

00:44:57.333 --> 00:45:00.000
We have to prove to the court
that you didn't plagiarize.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:04.625
As a lawyer,
it's your responsibility to prove it.

00:45:04.708 --> 00:45:07.750
There's nothing to prove.
The evidence is against you.

00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:10.625
Quit if you can't do it.
I'll get another lawyer.

00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:12.458
Okay. Good luck.

00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:23.333
Okay. Fuck off! What the...

00:45:25.416 --> 00:45:27.833
I can't deal with him.
Hire another lawyer.

00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:29.875
-He's too adamant.
-What happened?

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.166
It's a simple open and shut case.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.750
I can't help him if he doesn't cooperate.

00:45:35.125 --> 00:45:39.166
He's really important to me.
Please don't give up on him.

00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.333
Really? What is he to you?

00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:55.625
Your boyfriend?

00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:57.083
It's a long story.

00:45:57.375 --> 00:45:58.625
Okay. None of my business.

00:45:58.708 --> 00:46:02.416
Well, I can get a bail order for him.
But I can't take up this case.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.250
His opponent's lawyer
is Mr. Krishnamurthy.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.625
To go up against him is nothing less
than hitting a dead wall. Impossible.

00:46:09.708 --> 00:46:11.708
You know, I have his photo in my office.

00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:12.708
Why?

00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:17.125
He is my inspiration.
I aspire to become a lawyer like him.

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:21.333
If you want to become as great as him,
you have to beat a lawyer of his stature.

00:46:21.875 --> 00:46:25.416
Now you have that opportunity.
Please think about it.

00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:34.916
"Copyright case OS no. 234 of 2021,"

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.375
"complainant SR Publishers
accused on Vasudev Ghanta."

00:46:38.583 --> 00:46:40.250
Yes, proceed.

00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:46.708
Your Honor, my client, SR Publishers,

00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:49.250
is a leading publishing house
in the country.

00:46:49.833 --> 00:46:53.625
They have contributed a lot
to the growth of literature

00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:55.666
in our country, Your Honor.

00:46:56.666 --> 00:46:58.833
Now, coming to the point,
the issue here is,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.583
this man here, named Vasudev

00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:03.833
plagiarized from Astitva,
which is my client's intellectual property

00:47:03.916 --> 00:47:05.166
and a best-selling novel.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.625
The accused converted it into a script,
and made a movie out of it.

00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:12.625
That is not all, Your Honor.

00:47:14.625 --> 00:47:18.291
He has plagiarized two more books,
converted them into scripts,

00:47:18.416 --> 00:47:20.791
and sold them
to a Bollywood production house.

00:47:21.416 --> 00:47:22.291
Mr. Vasudev did that.

00:47:24.583 --> 00:47:27.791
These stories were authored
by a legendary Bengali-Telugu writer,

00:47:27.875 --> 00:47:31.333
who shook the entire nation
and the government alike

00:47:31.416 --> 00:47:33.416
with his writings in the 1970s.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.000
His name is Shyam Singha Roy.

00:47:37.291 --> 00:47:39.000
I'm submitting to the court

00:47:39.166 --> 00:47:42.791
the copies of the original novel
and the plagiarized script by Mr. Vasudev.

00:47:43.375 --> 00:47:44.333
Please.

00:47:48.083 --> 00:47:51.250
WHERE THERE IS DHARMA,
THERE WILL BE VICTORY

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:52.375
UNIKI

00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:53.583
ASTITVA

00:47:53.708 --> 00:47:55.958
Your Honor, it's a color-able imitation
of the original

00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:58.375
with the sole purpose of deriving profits.

00:47:58.708 --> 00:48:00.625
It's a direct infringement of three novels

00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:03.791
which are copyright properties
of my client, SR Publishers.

00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:05.833
So now, on behalf of my client,

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:09.166
under section 63
of the copyright act 1957,

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.708
I hereby demand that Mr. Vasu
be sentenced to five years of imprisonment

00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:14.541
and a penalty of Rs. 10 crores
be levied upon him.

00:48:15.333 --> 00:48:18.958
Also, a 50 percent share in the revenue
generated by the plagiarized film

00:48:19.041 --> 00:48:21.250
should be granted to my client.

00:48:23.541 --> 00:48:25.875
That'll be all for now, Your Honor.
Thank you so much.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.666
Defense.

00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:39.583
You may put forward your case.

00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:41.833
-Plead guilty.
-Impossible.

00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:46.500
Your Honor, this is a false accusation.

00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:48.875
My client doesn't accept this accusation.

00:48:49.041 --> 00:48:50.291
We plead not guilty.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.791
My client is innocent until proven guilty.

00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:56.291
The court has verified
the copies of both the works.

00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:58.750
98 percent of the content
is exactly the same.

00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:01.208
How could he have written it
without plagiarizing?

00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:03.208
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:07.166
The prima facie evidence is sufficient
for the court to believe that he's guilty.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.583
Then how do you defend
and prove your innocence?

00:49:09.666 --> 00:49:11.708
I don't know
why both the works are the same.

00:49:11.958 --> 00:49:14.875
But I can tell you this,
I didn't copy my stories from any book.

00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:16.458
My stories are my creation.

00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:19.208
You can conduct a lie detection test
if you want.

00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:24.166
What? This is not a movie. Lie detection
tests are not approved just like that.

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:25.708
-What do you...
-Your Honor...

00:49:26.166 --> 00:49:27.166
Let's do that.

00:49:28.083 --> 00:49:29.458
It will save everyone's time.

00:49:29.541 --> 00:49:31.708
Let's go ahead
with the lie detection test.

00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:33.583
Defense?

00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:37.833
That is the request from the defense, sir.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.125
Okay.

00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:42.375
According to the section 45,
selection of evidence,

00:49:42.458 --> 00:49:45.500
the court authorizes
the forensic department

00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:47.875
to conduct a lie detection test
on Mr. Vasudev.

00:50:17.416 --> 00:50:22.041
The forensic department has concluded
that Mr. Vasudev is not lying.

00:50:28.583 --> 00:50:31.083
Your Honor, the lie detection test
can only be considered

00:50:31.166 --> 00:50:34.291
as corroborative evidence
but not as complete evidence.

00:50:34.833 --> 00:50:37.125
I'm sure the defense
is well aware about this.

00:50:37.541 --> 00:50:40.708
It is not impossible
to cheat the lie detection test.

00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:44.708
The accused is yet
to prove himself innocent.

00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:47.916
Until then, the charges against
Mr. Vasudev will remain valid.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.208
That's all, Your Honor.

00:50:49.625 --> 00:50:52.791
Your Honor, we need more time
to prove my client's innocence.

00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:54.958
To look deep into the issue
and gather more evidence.

00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:57.916
I also request for an unconditional bail
for my client.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.583
Your Honor,
I object to the unconditional bail.

00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:02.041
Overruled.

00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:07.291
The court grants
unconditional bail to Mr. Vasudev

00:51:07.375 --> 00:51:11.916
and also grants a period of three days
to the defense to submit further evidence.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.291
Until then, the court is adjourned.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.083
I believe that he has plagiarized.

00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:24.500
Nowadays, young filmmakers
are increasingly plagiarizing other works

00:51:24.583 --> 00:51:26.250
and calling that as inspiration.

00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:28.625
Such people must not be granted bail.

00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:35.958
How are you?

00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:37.708
I'm fine.

00:51:42.958 --> 00:51:44.333
This shirt looks good on you.

00:51:46.666 --> 00:51:48.000
I got arrested after wearing it.

00:51:58.291 --> 00:51:59.125
But...

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.125
Thank you.

00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:04.791
I am the one who got you bail.
You should be thanking me.

00:52:05.583 --> 00:52:07.708
First, you need to trust me.
Then, I'll thank you.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.166
How can I trust you?

00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:11.791
Your work exactly matches
the content of those books.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.666
I don't get it either.

00:52:16.958 --> 00:52:18.458
How can they be so similar?

00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:22.666
Give me those books.

00:52:30.708 --> 00:52:32.291
Shyam Singha Roy.

00:52:33.125 --> 00:52:35.666
I think the 'SR' in SR Publishers
stands for Singha Roy.

00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:39.291
I have studied this family.

00:52:42.791 --> 00:52:44.875
Shyam's mother was a Telugu,
and father a Bengali.

00:52:44.958 --> 00:52:47.916
Theirs was a love marriage.
They settled in West Bengal.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.916
Shyam had three siblings
and he was the youngest.

00:52:52.166 --> 00:52:56.416
He was born in a village called Kalikapur
in the Kharagpur district of West Bengal.

00:52:57.083 --> 00:53:00.541
He became a famous writer
and a renowned social activist in Kolkata.

00:53:01.125 --> 00:53:02.750
Post the year 1977,

00:53:02.833 --> 00:53:05.708
there is no information available
on his whereabouts.

00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:10.000
If he is assumed dead,
no one knows where his grave is.

00:53:11.375 --> 00:53:15.541
In 1985, his three brothers
met with a tragic car accident.

00:53:16.125 --> 00:53:20.208
The children of those dead brothers
are currently running the company.

00:53:20.458 --> 00:53:21.958
They filed the case against you.

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:34.583
There are no photos of Shyam
except for the paintings in these books.

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:38.750
Since his mother was a Telugu,
Shyam was well-versed in Telugu as well.

00:53:38.875 --> 00:53:40.541
He wrote books in Telugu too.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.291
TRAITOR

00:54:00.875 --> 00:54:02.041
NAXALBARI

00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:16.041
TO MY BELOVED GOPAL

00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:21.625
Keri, a 10-year-old girl, was
donated by her father to a temple.

00:54:21.708 --> 00:54:27.333
"Her father donated her"

00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:35.875
"to a temple."

00:54:38.833 --> 00:54:39.875
Vasu.

00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:42.666
Your ear is bleeding again.

00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:50.583
Why is he bleeding?

00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:54.708
Sometimes he gets zoned out.

00:54:55.083 --> 00:54:56.750
And he forgets his surroundings.

00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:59.625
Whenever that happens,
he bleeds from his ear.

00:55:00.958 --> 00:55:03.125
How many times has it happened before?

00:55:04.125 --> 00:55:04.958
Many times.

00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:08.000
It happened on the day when we fought.

00:55:13.625 --> 00:55:15.000
Once while writing this script.

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:21.666
While shooting the short film.

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.333
And a few more times.

00:55:25.416 --> 00:55:27.125
We even consulted a doctor.

00:55:27.208 --> 00:55:29.583
He did some tests and said
that it was the result of stress.

00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:33.458
He was working on his first film.
He never slept properly the whole time.

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:37.750
Strange.

00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:40.916
Yes, ma'am. I really think
something is wrong with him.

00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:42.416
What do you think?

00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:46.791
A human mind is as mysterious

00:55:47.416 --> 00:55:50.208
as the whole universe.

00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:55.041
Nobody knows the infinite secrets
that are hidden within.

00:55:55.125 --> 00:55:58.541
Human consciousness
is an ocean full of secrets.

00:55:59.208 --> 00:56:02.375
How do you propose we unearth
the secrets of Vasu's mind?

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.583
We can try clinical hypnosis on him.

00:56:06.666 --> 00:56:07.708
Hypnosis?

00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:10.041
Yeah. With hypnotherapy,

00:56:10.208 --> 00:56:13.250
there is a chance to know what happens
inside Vasu's brain

00:56:13.375 --> 00:56:14.583
during those blackouts.

00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:18.291
Okay, ma'am. One final request.

00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:21.083
This is a sensitive case.

00:56:21.208 --> 00:56:23.583
So I urge you to deal
with this matter personally.

00:56:23.666 --> 00:56:24.583
Sure.

00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:30.875
Our print sales are declined by 23...

00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:32.041
Excuse us.

00:56:32.375 --> 00:56:33.500
He is out on bail.

00:56:33.916 --> 00:56:35.375
Also, he passed the lie detection test.

00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:43.166
Uncle!

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.833
Is it Shyam's story?

00:56:56.458 --> 00:56:57.375
Yes, Uncle.

00:57:10.875 --> 00:57:11.750
Sit.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:31.500
Hi, Vasu.

00:57:32.333 --> 00:57:33.916
From our conversation,

00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:37.958
I have noted down the dates
when you experienced those blackouts.

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.750
Vasu, I'm going to start
the procedure now.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.958
Just relax.

00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:03.625
Take a deep breath in.

00:58:04.041 --> 00:58:07.166
Inhale and exhale all your worries out.

00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:12.958
Follow my voice and look at the monitor.

00:58:25.583 --> 00:58:28.000
This book is your life.

00:58:31.416 --> 00:58:33.625
Do you know today's date?

00:58:37.041 --> 00:58:39.125
August 17th.

00:58:44.541 --> 00:58:47.625
Do you remember the day
when you were arrested?

00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:50.750
Last Thursday.

00:58:57.875 --> 00:58:59.708
When was your film released?

00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:02.625
July 7th.

00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:14.166
Vasu.

00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:16.416
Vasu.

00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:34.250
Let's go a little back.

00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:37.875
Do you remember the date
when you finished your script?

00:59:40.875 --> 00:59:42.083
October 19th.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.500
Vasu, what happened on that day?

00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:50.291
I had to submit my script the next day.

00:59:52.625 --> 00:59:55.458
However hard I tried,
I wasn't able to write the climax.

00:59:56.208 --> 00:59:57.791
I felt a severe headache.

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.625
I felt dizzy.

01:00:01.583 --> 01:00:04.333
My whole body felt very heavy.

01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:09.583
And?

01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:18.500
Come on, Vasu. Try harder.
Try to remember.

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.250
What happened after that?

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.583
What did you do?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.708
Try hard, Vasu. You can do it.

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:06.500
Rosie.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:11.708
Rosie?

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:25.125
Who is Rosie? How is she related to you?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.541
My wife.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:32.708
Vasu?

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:35.958
She's my wife.

01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:46.875
Did Rosie give you these Bengali books?

01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:51.750
These books were not published then.

01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:56.750
ASTITVA - NAXALBARI

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.333
What do you mean?

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:02.583
What year are we talking about?

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.125
1969.

01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:23.000
What is your name?

01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:42.333
Shyam Singha Roy.

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:18.208
1969, KALIKAPUR, WEST BENGAL,
MONTH OF ASHWAYUJA, RIVER GANGES

01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:25.750
Please give me some water.

01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:28.166
Sister, give me some water.

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:30.458
Please give me some water.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:36.833
What's the matter?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.250
Why don't you go and fetch yourself
some water instead of asking everyone?

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:46.416
We aren't supposed to touch the well, sir.

01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:50.500
Did the well forbid you?

01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:55.000
You can either wait for the rains,
or you can pluck up some courage.

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:07.625
Hey, Shyam!

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.000
He is a pariah.

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:12.250
He cannot touch the water from the well.

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.875
-What does that mean?
-He is beneath us.

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:21.166
The water comes from the ground
which is beneath our feet.

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:22.500
He is low caste.

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:24.166
Shouldn't he get thirsty then?

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.708
Water is not owned
by any particular caste.

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:32.250
He was born and raised in this village.
He belongs to this very land.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.500
The same land grows the food
which your children eat.

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.250
He is an untouchable.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.791
Then why are you walking
on the land that he walks on?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.875
Why are you breathing the same air
that he breathes? Stop breathing!

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:49.458
Land, air, and water
are life-preserving resources.

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:51.625
They don't abide by the evil caste system.

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.458
You can't impose caste hierarchy anymore.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:58.916
This isn't the age of Rigveda.
We now live in independent India.

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:02.250
An Ambedkar has arrived here!

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:05.416
You can write these ideas in your books.
Maybe we read them sometime.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.000
If you dare touch the water,

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:09.916
we will burn down your hut,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.916
and then, we'll skin you alive.

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:14.916
Sir, we don't want water.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.125
We will go away.

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:18.125
We will go away.

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:54.791
Now, this well is untouchable as well.

01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:56.541
This belongs to him.

01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.875
Those who are thirsty
can still draw water from here.

01:07:01.208 --> 01:07:03.291
Those who want to abide by caste
can die of thirst.

01:07:09.541 --> 01:07:11.458
Before you go near his hut,

01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:15.625
do keep in mind
that I know where your house is.

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:18.333
Beware!

01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:27.875
Very good.

01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:29.000
Well done, comrade.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:38.000
Friend, come and join us.

01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:41.750
One bullet can kill only one person.

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:44.916
Whereas one written word can mobilize
millions of people.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:11.541
"The sky is covered with clouds
and the sun has gone down."

01:08:11.916 --> 01:08:15.625
"Kuku went to fetch water
from the Padma Dighi sector."

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.833
It's Padma riverbank.

01:08:18.958 --> 01:08:20.375
Padma...

01:08:20.958 --> 01:08:21.958
Riverbank.

01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:26.833
Your father taught me this song
when I was your age.

01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:29.791
I'd sit on his lap and learn.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.750
Now it's my responsibility
to pass it on to you guys.

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:37.833
What have you done this time, Shyam?

01:08:38.958 --> 01:08:40.958
Your brother is very angry with you.

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:43.291
What did I do?

01:08:43.833 --> 01:08:45.875
Have I done something?

01:08:46.125 --> 01:08:50.083
Dadabhai is coming back from Kharagpur.
Be careful with him.

01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:54.333
No matter what he says to you,
don't talk back to him.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:56.291
Have some of this sacred food.

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:59.083
Do not fight during the festivities.

01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:00.458
What's the matter?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.625
Is it about today's incident?

01:09:04.958 --> 01:09:06.291
Or yesterday's incident?

01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:09.333
Or about the one from the day before?

01:09:15.708 --> 01:09:16.750
Sit here.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.208
Do you realize what you are doing?

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:27.916
You bring dishonor to our family.

01:09:28.375 --> 01:09:32.250
You threw a Dalit into the well.
Are you out of your mind?

01:09:32.333 --> 01:09:34.583
They will banish us from this village.

01:09:35.458 --> 01:09:37.083
Don't worry about that, brother.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.083
I'll leave this place.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.833
This is a place where some humans
are treated as filth by fellow humans.

01:09:46.083 --> 01:09:47.125
I can't stay here.

01:09:49.416 --> 01:09:50.250
Go away.

01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:54.541
Join those low-caste people
and dream of bringing a revolution.

01:09:54.833 --> 01:09:57.083
I've heard that you're mixing
with those armed revolutionaries.

01:10:01.041 --> 01:10:02.708
If I wanted to join them,

01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:05.416
I could find my way
to their base in the forest.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.541
My principles are different.

01:10:09.666 --> 01:10:13.041
Your principles and books
are good for nothing.

01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:16.000
Selfishness is the hallmark of human life.

01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:19.000
I agree. Selfishness is a great virtue.

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:22.083
You care for your family.
That's selfishness.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:25.000
I care about the world around me.
That's my selfishness.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:33.666
Shyam?

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:40.500
Don't be upset that he hit you.
He's our elder brother.

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.375
I am not upset with our brother.
I am upset about the society.

01:10:46.166 --> 01:10:49.375
It's not just one village,
this problem plagues the whole country.

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:52.000
Only literature can bring about
a change in society.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.416
Shyam.

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:56.833
I have to go. And I must write.

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.458
Have you packed already?

01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:06.000
Don't tell anyone.

01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:11.208
I bought the ticket for the Howrah Express
three days ago.

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:15.125
Festivities are going on.
Can't you wait until it is over?

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.958
The festival will come again next year.

01:11:21.166 --> 01:11:22.750
Lost time will never come back.

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:24.833
Anyway, I'm an atheist.

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:28.291
I'll leave at midnight
when everyone is asleep.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Please ask sister-in-law
to pack me some rasgullas.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:52.083
Shyam.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.791
Quit smoking.

01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:24.000
It's empty now. I've quit it.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.250
Be careful.
Write us a letter as soon as you reach.

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:43.333
Hey!

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.416
Do you know where the boatman is?

01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.083
It's the first day
of Navaratri festivities.

01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:00.625
He must be in the temple
along with the others.

01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:57.625
The protector of life

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.916
The ruler of the universe

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.041
Goddess Sridevi seated on a lotus

01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:16.208
Shower us with your compassion

01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:22.000
With magical steps

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:27.583
The soul dances to the tunes

01:14:28.416 --> 01:14:34.333
In sync with the multitude of names

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.750
Pour your blessings over me

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:16.250
My thoughts

01:15:17.833 --> 01:15:22.750
Should forever pay tributes to you

01:15:23.875 --> 01:15:28.791
The anguish within me

01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:34.375
Needs to be soothed
with your gentle affection

01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:42.083
I placed you in the temple of my body

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:48.458
My life is dedicated to your service

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:54.541
I saw you in every sacrifice
and every suffering

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.083
I've chanted only your name all my life

01:16:04.375 --> 01:16:07.000
With magical steps

01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:12.416
The soul dances to the tunes

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:18.791
In sync with the multitude of names

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:23.375
Pour your blessings over me

01:16:25.041 --> 01:16:28.291
I seek your refuge,

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:31.916
O Goddess of art

01:16:32.041 --> 01:16:37.375
The ruler of the world

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:40.875
Aren't you the protector

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.166
Of those who are vulnerable?

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:49.166
Please respond to my prayers

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.250
Bro, are you looking for me?
It's getting late. Let's go.

01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:31.583
Girls, move quickly.

01:17:31.791 --> 01:17:33.791
There is a crowd behind us. Move quickly.

01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:38.833
You danced very well.

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:46.041
-Move...
-Please bless my child.

01:17:47.416 --> 01:17:48.500
Move it.

01:17:48.958 --> 01:17:50.083
Girls, don't be late.

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:03.125
Come on.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.666
Bro, let's go.

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:22.791
Why are they taking them inside?

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:25.666
They are devadasis
who migrated from Bangladesh.

01:18:25.833 --> 01:18:27.625
The wives of the deity.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.750
No man is supposed
to lay his eyes on them.

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:31.625
They are held captive in there.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:34.625
They come to the temple to dance,
and then again go back.

01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:37.125
They offer many services inside.

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:40.458
They entertain and satisfy the deity
with their dance and whatnot.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:48.416
Hey, wait!

01:18:57.583 --> 01:18:59.958
Look, girls. All of you get up.

01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:01.500
Stand in a line.

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:03.208
Mahant is here.

01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:40.458
That girl.

01:19:57.208 --> 01:19:58.041
Look here.

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:00.875
Get her ready soon.

01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:03.083
If it's delayed, I will see to your end.

01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:37.416
Faster. Move.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.000
There are people following us.
Come on, move fast.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.375
What happened?

01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:44.041
Move your feet.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:49.916
Quickly. What are you looking at?

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:53.333
Girls, get in quickly.

01:20:56.875 --> 01:20:58.250
You dance beautifully.

01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:01.625
I need to talk to you.

01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:04.750
Will you come out with me?

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:08.875
What's your name?

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.916
Hey, Maitreyi! Come, move it.

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:17.583
Come on, make it fast.
What are you looking at?

01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:18.708
Maitreyi.

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:20.083
Come.

01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:48.083
What's the matter?
Why aren't you asleep yet?

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:49.958
What are you thinking?

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:54.416
Shashi, do you know
what happened out there?

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:57.416
A guy asked me to go out with him.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:58.666
Go out?

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:02.208
I mean, to go outside the temple.

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.916
-Are you serious?
-Hush!

01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:06.791
Yes.

01:22:07.333 --> 01:22:08.750
Are you going?

01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:10.458
Going where?

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:13.750
You know we can't do that.

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:17.708
How dare he ask me to go out with him!

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.916
He must have considered us normal humans.

01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:29.583
Had I been in your place,
I would've gone away with him right then.

01:22:30.291 --> 01:22:32.416
Of course, you would.

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:37.791
If someone listens to our conversation,
we will be punished and locked up.

01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:39.000
Go to sleep.

01:22:44.458 --> 01:22:47.416
Anyway, how can we go out with a stranger?

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:52.708
Higher! Higher!

01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:57.875
Didn't you leave for Kolkata
to write your books?

01:22:58.666 --> 01:23:02.500
What's the hurry?
Let the nine-day festivities get over.

01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:05.708
Since when did you turn into a theist?

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:07.416
It's not theism.

01:23:11.666 --> 01:23:12.583
It's love.

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:14.958
THIRD NIGHT

01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:18.250
Thus Binodini, a devadasi,

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:24.208
spent her entire life in the temple

01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:27.416
and attained the path to heaven.

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.583
Didn't Binodini

01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:32.750
ever step out of the temple threshold?

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:34.416
No.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.458
Why?

01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:40.625
It is our culture, a devadasi,
wife of a deity,

01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:42.916
is not supposed to leave
the shelter of God.

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:45.333
Isn't this whole world a shelter of God?

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:47.916
So, what's wrong if they come out?

01:23:48.666 --> 01:23:49.958
Poor Binodini!

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:54.250
She could never experience the beauty
of this world, which your God created.

01:23:54.541 --> 01:23:56.958
Instead of living a 100 years as a slave,

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.291
living one day as a free human being
is more meaningful.

01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:10.333
Everyone, come and take the sacred food.

01:24:27.083 --> 01:24:28.666
Come to the south entrance at 10 pm.

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:31.125
I'll be waiting for you.

01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:40.541
I thought you must have left.

01:26:40.875 --> 01:26:41.958
I knew you would come.

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:44.750
I don't want to go out.

01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:48.833
I came here to see
if you were really waiting here.

01:26:50.375 --> 01:26:51.291
Okay.

01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:12.583
Come.

01:27:29.708 --> 01:27:30.625
Maitreyi!

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.000
That's the name the temple gave you.

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:35.625
What's the name your parents gave you?

01:27:37.166 --> 01:27:39.166
I'll have to ask them if I ever meet them.

01:27:43.916 --> 01:27:46.208
How do you know Telugu?

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:50.708
The teachers from Andhra taught me
Kuchipudi dance and Telugu.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.375
I learned Tamil along with Bharatanatyam.

01:27:53.458 --> 01:27:55.291
I learned Malayalam
along with Mohiniyattam.

01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:58.041
Also, I know Odiya, Assamese,
and Sanskrit too.

01:27:58.583 --> 01:28:00.083
Do you know how to row a boat?

01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:03.500
No.

01:28:05.916 --> 01:28:06.833
I'll teach you.

01:28:08.375 --> 01:28:09.208
Hold this.

01:28:23.291 --> 01:28:25.791
There are two ways to do
any activity in this world.

01:28:25.916 --> 01:28:26.916
One, with fear.

01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:28.250
And the other...

01:28:33.166 --> 01:28:34.291
With love.

01:28:53.666 --> 01:28:56.875
Just like the way you dance.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.208
What do you do?

01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:15.000
I'm a writer.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:16.833
I write.

01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:18.958
What do you write?

01:29:20.875 --> 01:29:22.708
The things I need to tell this world.

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:27.083
How will you tell this world about me?

01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:32.166
Milky cheeks...

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:35.500
The skin that radiates a golden glow...

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.583
The eyes that resemble a child in fear...

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:41.000
Flowy hair...

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:44.000
The figure,
that of a finely chiseled sculpture...

01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:45.458
Dances like a peacock...

01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.708
A maiden who never tasted
the love of her parents...

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:52.125
Living in companionship with a rock...

01:29:52.958 --> 01:29:55.500
Though the body has been violated
in the name of God,

01:29:58.250 --> 01:30:00.791
yet the heart is filled with holiness.

01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:09.750
It's almost dawn.

01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:12.875
I have to go. Please take me back.

01:30:13.791 --> 01:30:15.958
Time just flies by while talking with you.

01:30:26.708 --> 01:30:28.875
By the way, what's your name?

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.166
Shyam.

01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:32.625
Shyam Singha Roy.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.833
FOURTH NIGHT

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:54.958
Two star-crossed lovers

01:30:55.166 --> 01:31:00.666
Brought together
by this resplendent moonlight

01:31:01.875 --> 01:31:07.416
Despite a great distance between us

01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:12.208
We meet on this riverbank

01:31:12.458 --> 01:31:15.125
Opening the curtains of midnight

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:19.625
While this river was deep asleep

01:31:19.916 --> 01:31:23.500
You emerged like a dream
That I never saw before

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.291
The glimmer in her eyes,
The shimmer on her cheeks

01:31:28.541 --> 01:31:31.291
The jingle in her ankle bells

01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:34.500
A dream never seen before

01:31:46.208 --> 01:31:49.041
Mesmerized by the beauty of this love

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:51.875
This autumn night has become envious of us

01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:55.666
The purest form of art
in her glittering eyes

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:57.500
Casts a spell

01:31:57.708 --> 01:32:00.458
Her beauty is unrivaled

01:32:00.541 --> 01:32:03.208
Nothing can ever surpass it

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:09.416
Perhaps she is the image
of all this is beautiful in this creation

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:13.833
As beautiful as the place
where the sky meets the earth

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.541
FIFTH NIGHT

01:32:19.625 --> 01:32:22.125
He is Manoj Singha Roy,
my third elder brother.

01:32:23.083 --> 01:32:26.208
My eldest brother is like a father figure,
whereas he is like a mother to me.

01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:29.000
This is my friend.

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:30.000
Hello.

01:32:30.083 --> 01:32:31.291
Who are you related to?

01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:33.458
She is related to God.

01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.333
SIXTH NIGHT

01:32:59.083 --> 01:33:00.041
She is...

01:33:04.833 --> 01:33:10.125
Ripping away the screen,
I'm looking at the beaming beauty

01:33:10.291 --> 01:33:12.958
Breaking away all boundaries

01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:15.583
Darkness meets light

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:21.166
The starry night looks at her in amazement

01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:26.625
The jubilation of my soul knows no bounds

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:32.250
The inception of this story was
predestined on the eve of Navaratri

01:33:32.791 --> 01:33:35.416
The silence turns
Into affectionate memories

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.250
Turn into delightful poetry

01:33:38.333 --> 01:33:44.000
And shows glimpse of all the stories
Yet to be written

01:33:44.083 --> 01:33:48.416
The glimmer in her eyes,
The shimmer on her cheeks

01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:51.375
The jingle of her ankle bells

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.375
A dream never seen before

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:57.708
Mesmerized by the beauty of this love

01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:00.625
This autumn night has become envious of us

01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:04.500
The purest form of art
In her glittering eyes

01:34:04.625 --> 01:34:06.125
Casts a spell

01:34:06.416 --> 01:34:09.166
Her beauty is unrivaled

01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:12.041
Nothing can ever surpass it

01:34:12.125 --> 01:34:16.375
Perhaps she is the image
of all that is beautiful in this creation

01:34:16.458 --> 01:34:17.416
Shyam...

01:34:18.041 --> 01:34:22.708
You're like a rose that spreads beauty
and bliss while surrounded by thorns.

01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:30.000
Today onwards your name is...

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.416
Rosie!

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:37.708
As beautiful as the place
where the sky meets the earth

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:40.208
Rosie!

01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:46.291
The glimmer in her eyes,
The shimmer on her cheeks

01:34:46.375 --> 01:34:49.125
The jingle of her ankle bells

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.750
A dream never seen before

01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:10.750
NINTH NIGHT

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.291
Come away with me, Rosie.

01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:24.583
I come out with you every day.

01:38:28.375 --> 01:38:29.333
Not like this.

01:38:30.291 --> 01:38:33.166
Get out of this captivity
and come into my life.

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:35.375
Come to Kolkata with me.

01:38:36.708 --> 01:38:39.541
We shall get married
and start a new life together.

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:46.916
Shyam, don't forget that I am a devadasi.

01:38:48.833 --> 01:38:50.708
A woman is a slave to none.

01:38:52.875 --> 01:38:55.541
And the one who desires enslavement
can never be God.

01:38:56.916 --> 01:38:59.250
This is human slavery
under the guise of God.

01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:01.208
Forget it.

01:39:03.625 --> 01:39:05.166
Tell me, are you happy?

01:39:06.291 --> 01:39:07.541
Do you want to live like a slave?

01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:13.541
There are no other festivities
in my life except these nine nights.

01:39:16.416 --> 01:39:18.416
Nobody wishes to lead such a life.

01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:22.666
We live it out thinking
this is what destiny has in store for us.

01:39:25.208 --> 01:39:27.666
Nothing is superior to one's self-respect.

01:39:28.791 --> 01:39:31.666
There is nothing wrong in standing up
for what is right.

01:39:33.333 --> 01:39:35.208
Only cowards talk about destiny.

01:39:35.666 --> 01:39:37.500
Why do you undermine your own value?

01:39:37.583 --> 01:39:38.541
Ridiculous!

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.083
How can I say what my worth is?

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:48.416
My life was bartered for a sack of rice,
that is my worth.

01:39:50.666 --> 01:39:53.250
A sculpture in that temple
is worthier than me.

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.875
Your worth cannot be determined by
any one, no matter who they are.

01:39:59.958 --> 01:40:03.166
It is what you believe,
the belief that you have in yourself.

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.791
Can I survive in the outside world?

01:40:09.958 --> 01:40:12.625
Will this society accept me
if I leave the temple?

01:40:13.375 --> 01:40:14.333
Tell me.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.375
Have you heard about MS Subbalakshmi?

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.291
She was a devadasi too.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:22.791
But today she is a Padma Bhushan awardee.

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:26.333
Balasaraswathi,
the greatest Bharatanatyam dancer in India

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.000
belongs to a devadasi family.

01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:33.125
You have mastered
the art of classical dance.

01:40:36.541 --> 01:40:39.583
I am with you, and always will be.

01:40:40.958 --> 01:40:42.291
You can have a life that you desire.

01:40:42.958 --> 01:40:44.750
You need not fear anyone.

01:40:45.541 --> 01:40:46.875
Tomorrow is Vijayadashami.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.291
I'll be waiting for you.

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:54.166
Across this river,
there is a world awaiting our arrival.

01:41:06.083 --> 01:41:11.458
VIJAYADASHAMI

01:42:14.666 --> 01:42:18.500
Careful, hold this. Over here.

01:42:18.916 --> 01:42:21.250
Oh, God. You are so badly injured.

01:42:23.333 --> 01:42:24.458
I'm so sorry for this.

01:42:27.416 --> 01:42:29.041
Here...

01:42:29.125 --> 01:42:30.000
Careful.

01:42:45.708 --> 01:42:46.791
What happened?

01:42:49.333 --> 01:42:50.250
What happened?

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:56.958
Be careful.

01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:03.750
Girls, where are you?

01:43:05.208 --> 01:43:06.083
Come fast.

01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:08.041
Mahant is here.

01:43:11.708 --> 01:43:13.916
Come, stand in line.

01:43:14.958 --> 01:43:15.916
Come fast.

01:43:35.625 --> 01:43:36.458
That girl.

01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:56.458
Let go of me. I won't come.

01:43:56.583 --> 01:43:58.000
Leave me, I won't come.

01:44:02.083 --> 01:44:03.250
I won't go.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.291
I don't want to go.

01:44:18.208 --> 01:44:19.291
It's a full moon night.

01:44:21.875 --> 01:44:22.958
We won't come.

01:44:25.708 --> 01:44:27.208
We are wives of God.

01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:29.916
It means, we are like goddesses.

01:44:30.833 --> 01:44:33.916
We are not sculptures
that anyone can lay hands on.

01:44:36.416 --> 01:44:37.500
We are human beings.

01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:41.333
Nobody owns us.

01:44:44.916 --> 01:44:46.125
Not even the God.

01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:00.833
How dare you speak against me!

01:45:20.166 --> 01:45:23.291
You are not a slave of God,
but you're a slave of mine.

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:04.041
Mahant's word is always final.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.291
Go from that side.

01:46:48.958 --> 01:46:49.958
Go from that side.

01:46:53.833 --> 01:46:54.791
Hey! Move fast.

01:47:41.291 --> 01:47:42.541
Who the hell are you?

01:47:45.375 --> 01:47:46.708
How dare you!

01:50:00.583 --> 01:50:01.541
Catch him.

01:50:03.916 --> 01:50:05.375
Don't let him get away.

01:51:16.333 --> 01:51:18.916
Every woman is as sacred
as a temple sanctum.

01:51:19.208 --> 01:51:22.958
What should be done to the wild dog
that contaminates a temple sanctum?

01:51:41.708 --> 01:51:43.625
A woman is not a slave to anyone.

01:51:44.625 --> 01:51:47.583
Not even to God.

01:51:49.833 --> 01:51:50.916
Beware!

01:52:23.250 --> 01:52:24.208
Get down.

01:52:24.291 --> 01:52:26.083
Come on, get down.

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:29.666
DAINIK BANGLA

01:52:53.916 --> 01:52:56.500
ROYAL PRESS PROP. SAYAN SARKAR

01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:05.250
Yes?

01:53:05.333 --> 01:53:06.708
I need some work.

01:53:13.083 --> 01:53:14.916
I can give you a job without pay.

01:53:16.125 --> 01:53:18.125
But I will take care of food
and accommodation.

01:53:19.083 --> 01:53:20.666
In that case, we are two people.

01:53:29.291 --> 01:53:30.125
Oh.

01:54:18.166 --> 01:54:21.666
Grandpa asked me to give this to you.

01:54:35.708 --> 01:54:37.000
They'll be here in an hour.

01:54:39.083 --> 01:54:40.208
I don't know how to cook.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.250
Can I have one more rasgulla?

01:54:59.375 --> 01:55:01.375
-Do you want to learn to dance?
-Yes.

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:25.833
You can never bear a child.

01:56:27.375 --> 01:56:28.750
I'm very sorry.

01:56:33.958 --> 01:56:35.250
Why do you need kids?

01:56:37.541 --> 01:56:38.666
Am I not enough?

01:56:56.625 --> 01:56:59.625
Type this and compose
the rest of the text.

01:57:00.041 --> 01:57:01.208
I'll check it.

01:57:01.333 --> 01:57:02.250
Sir.

01:57:03.541 --> 01:57:07.583
I have written an article on the topic
that you've been working on.

01:57:08.166 --> 01:57:09.500
Would you like to see it once?

01:57:10.541 --> 01:57:11.500
Show me.

01:57:19.708 --> 01:57:21.291
What nonsense have you written?

01:57:21.375 --> 01:57:23.458
You can't just write
whatever comes to your mind.

01:57:29.958 --> 01:57:31.250
Print this one.

01:57:51.416 --> 01:57:53.166
You are a great writer.

01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:58.958
And I take full responsibility of printing
your first book.

01:57:59.916 --> 01:58:00.916
Thank you.

01:58:05.833 --> 01:58:09.291
He is the personification of literature

01:58:10.333 --> 01:58:14.000
That which is born out of the paper

01:58:14.666 --> 01:58:18.708
To annihilate the injustice in this world

01:58:19.625 --> 01:58:24.708
The pen which has The sharpness of a sword

01:58:25.875 --> 01:58:27.708
He is Shyam Singha Roy

01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:30.458
He is a raging tempest

01:58:32.625 --> 01:58:34.750
His struggle is a retaliation
against injustice

01:58:34.833 --> 01:58:36.833
ASTITVA

01:58:36.916 --> 01:58:39.416
Nothing can suppress his intelligence

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:41.208
ASTITVA

01:58:45.958 --> 01:58:47.708
Hey, congratulations!

01:58:48.208 --> 01:58:49.500
The book became a huge success.

01:58:58.125 --> 01:59:01.958
His writing creates quite a stir

01:59:02.708 --> 01:59:06.208
He strives to seek the truth

01:59:07.125 --> 01:59:10.833
He fights for the welfare of people

01:59:12.291 --> 01:59:15.041
We're arresting you for writing
against the government.

01:59:15.625 --> 01:59:17.583
Red salute to the revolutionaries!

01:59:17.875 --> 01:59:21.958
Every printed page
carries his struggle forward

01:59:22.041 --> 01:59:22.958
Start printing.

01:59:23.041 --> 01:59:25.791
He wages a war of words
with the cruelest of rulers

01:59:29.791 --> 01:59:31.750
Shyam Singha Roy

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.375
He is a raging tempest

01:59:34.458 --> 01:59:36.541
Shyam Singha Roy

01:59:36.625 --> 01:59:38.750
To annihilate the injustice in this world

01:59:38.833 --> 01:59:41.000
Shyam Singha Roy

01:59:41.125 --> 01:59:43.583
Nothing can suppress his intelligence

01:59:43.666 --> 01:59:45.000
Shyam Singha Roy

01:59:50.125 --> 01:59:52.500
He is a raging tempest

01:59:58.875 --> 01:59:59.916
Royalty checks.

02:00:02.041 --> 02:00:04.541
Let's buy a piece of land
and build our own house.

02:00:09.041 --> 02:00:10.291
What's the matter, Rosie?

02:00:10.875 --> 02:00:14.500
I was lucky to find you
and I escaped from their captivity.

02:00:15.625 --> 02:00:18.333
If there were 25 devadasis
in just one temple,

02:00:18.416 --> 02:00:20.125
in temples across the nation,

02:00:20.208 --> 02:00:23.166
just imagine how many devadasis
must be living under subjugation.

02:00:23.250 --> 02:00:27.375
But society doesn't have
any regard for them.

02:00:28.041 --> 02:00:30.208
Who will liberate them
from their struggles?

02:00:30.291 --> 02:00:32.583
Who is responsible
for their children's future?

02:00:45.583 --> 02:00:47.958
If the pen becomes a weapon,
and if the ink says revolution

02:00:48.041 --> 02:00:50.333
When the hyenas attack,
the society wins again

02:00:50.416 --> 02:00:52.208
Beware!
They're always trying to put you down

02:00:52.291 --> 02:00:54.625
The name has lion in it,
There is no way Shyam can lose

02:00:54.708 --> 02:00:56.958
The ones who want to snatch your food,
they get scared

02:00:57.041 --> 02:00:59.208
TRAITOR

02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:01.625
He bleeds blue,
His slogans raise processions

02:01:01.708 --> 02:01:03.583
His burning questions are loosening
The lock on temple doors

02:01:03.666 --> 02:01:08.458
When Shyam walks on the road,
He teaches how to cross all boundaries

02:01:08.541 --> 02:01:13.458
No one is a prisoner anymore,
It's a checkmate of the queens

02:01:13.541 --> 02:01:17.791
In a community where a woman
sells her flesh to feed herself,

02:01:18.166 --> 02:01:20.208
all men from that community are impotent.

02:01:21.375 --> 02:01:23.291
Women are not a commodity!

02:01:23.875 --> 02:01:26.250
He is a symbol of revolt

02:01:26.333 --> 02:01:30.375
Who care if you're good or bad

02:01:30.458 --> 02:01:32.666
Who knows no difference between races

02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:37.000
Absolute freedom is your dream

02:01:37.583 --> 02:01:41.291
None of your detractors or rivals
can harm you

02:01:41.666 --> 02:01:46.333
No matter where a woman lives,
She continues to face subjugation

02:01:46.416 --> 02:01:50.708
A woman is regarded as Goddess Kali,
But they are shackled by patriarchy

02:01:50.791 --> 02:01:54.250
She owes her freedom to you

02:01:54.333 --> 02:01:56.583
Shyam Singha Roy

02:01:56.666 --> 02:01:59.000
He is a raging tempest

02:01:59.083 --> 02:02:01.250
Shyam Singha Roy

02:02:01.416 --> 02:02:03.750
His struggle is a retaliation
against injustice

02:02:03.833 --> 02:02:05.791
Shyam Singha Roy

02:02:05.916 --> 02:02:08.166
Nothing can suppress his intelligence

02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:10.083
Shyam Singha Roy

02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:17.708
He is a raging tempest

02:02:17.791 --> 02:02:19.166
ASTITVA

02:02:19.916 --> 02:02:21.916
TO DOWN WITH SHYAM SINGHA ROY

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.666
Shyam Singha Roy

02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:24.916
I AM A FAN OF YOUR IDEAS

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.083
He is a force to be reckoned with
Shyam Singha Roy

02:02:28.166 --> 02:02:32.958
Singha Roy...

02:02:45.250 --> 02:02:46.500
Many more are coming.

02:02:47.583 --> 02:02:49.375
We can't accommodate them all here.

02:02:49.958 --> 02:02:53.208
I'm planning to provide housing
and jobs to those who can work,

02:02:53.958 --> 02:02:56.375
and a pension for those who can't work.

02:02:57.583 --> 02:02:59.333
Even the government will help me in this.

02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:13.125
I have no worries in my mind.

02:03:15.083 --> 02:03:16.958
It is as clear as this moonless sky.

02:03:21.083 --> 02:03:22.541
Is this what we call happiness?

02:03:25.333 --> 02:03:27.666
Shyam, you know what?

02:03:28.583 --> 02:03:32.708
It is said that a devadasi who dies on
a new moon day will be unified with God.

02:03:34.375 --> 02:03:36.583
Whenever death comes knocking at my door--

02:03:38.583 --> 02:03:42.000
I want to die on a new moon day like this,
lying on your lap,

02:03:42.583 --> 02:03:46.750
staring at you in my last moments
with a smile on my lips.

02:03:49.458 --> 02:03:50.833
That's my final wish.

02:04:16.083 --> 02:04:17.791
Our elder brother is unwell.

02:04:18.208 --> 02:04:19.500
He wants to see you.

02:04:20.833 --> 02:04:21.916
Will you come home once?

02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:52.708
I'm scared of that village.

02:04:53.833 --> 02:04:55.708
After all that has happened there,

02:04:55.958 --> 02:04:58.916
I don't feel good about
you going back to that village.

02:05:02.541 --> 02:05:03.666
Don't go, Shyam.

02:05:06.458 --> 02:05:08.000
I lost my parents in my childhood.

02:05:09.166 --> 02:05:11.250
My brother has been
a father figure to me since then.

02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:15.875
I have to go, Rosie.

02:05:18.291 --> 02:05:21.333
Fear shouldn't constrain
my love for my family.

02:05:28.875 --> 02:05:30.500
Take care. Even if it takes a while...

02:05:33.041 --> 02:05:34.208
I promise,

02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:36.583
I'll be back.

02:06:13.875 --> 02:06:17.125
I read your books without
the knowledge of our brothers.

02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:19.375
I've collected all your books.

02:06:19.666 --> 02:06:21.791
I'm your biggest fan.

02:06:29.166 --> 02:06:30.708
What are you writing? Is it a new story?

02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:32.666
A short story.

02:06:33.375 --> 02:06:34.416
I've just got the idea.

02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:42.000
Read it and tell me your opinion.

02:06:54.041 --> 02:06:56.416
Sister-in-law, Shyam is here!

02:06:56.958 --> 02:06:58.791
Everybody come here.

02:07:01.333 --> 02:07:02.416
How are you?

02:07:03.166 --> 02:07:04.625
I'm fine. How are you?

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:05.958
I'm good. Have some food.

02:07:06.041 --> 02:07:07.291
Serve him food.

02:07:07.416 --> 02:07:08.333
Hurry up.

02:07:10.416 --> 02:07:12.458
Go and get some coconuts from the market.

02:07:12.833 --> 02:07:14.750
I'll get some rasgullas as well, okay?

02:07:15.333 --> 02:07:16.333
Take care of him.

02:07:22.125 --> 02:07:23.166
Why is the house so silent?

02:07:23.625 --> 02:07:24.666
Where are the kids?

02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:27.541
They are in Kharagpur,
pursuing their studies there.

02:07:35.083 --> 02:07:36.333
How are you, Sister-in-law?

02:07:42.833 --> 02:07:43.958
What happened?

02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:45.500
Are you all right?

02:07:45.875 --> 02:07:48.833
Nothing like that. Have your food, Shyam.

02:07:52.625 --> 02:07:53.708
Sit.

02:07:55.708 --> 02:07:57.666
You may go inside.

02:08:04.125 --> 02:08:05.666
How is your health, Brother?

02:08:05.875 --> 02:08:06.833
Fine.

02:08:08.875 --> 02:08:12.291
Everybody is talking about you.

02:08:12.625 --> 02:08:15.000
I read about you
in the newspapers as well.

02:08:15.375 --> 02:08:17.458
You have become a great person.

02:08:20.458 --> 02:08:23.791
I haven't read any of your books.

02:08:24.750 --> 02:08:27.208
I don't like your thoughts anyway.

02:08:28.166 --> 02:08:30.583
But you have done well in your life,

02:08:31.333 --> 02:08:32.708
that's good enough for me.

02:08:34.125 --> 02:08:36.916
We can't do away with blood relationships.

02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:39.166
I can't keep you away.

02:08:40.333 --> 02:08:42.458
I've arranged a match for you,
from our caste.

02:08:43.166 --> 02:08:45.208
Meet her once, and then get married.

02:08:47.291 --> 02:08:51.250
You can continue
your social service from here.

02:09:02.875 --> 02:09:04.208
I'm already married, Brother.

02:09:10.833 --> 02:09:14.166
If this is what you wanted to discuss,
then I'm done with it.

02:09:14.458 --> 02:09:17.208
We will never accept that prostitute
as a daughter-in-law in this house.

02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:20.625
She's my wife.

02:09:21.333 --> 02:09:22.666
Rosie Singha Roy.

02:09:23.416 --> 02:09:26.500
If you speak ill of her once again,
I'd make you pay for it.

02:09:26.833 --> 02:09:27.708
Beware!

02:10:47.166 --> 02:10:50.875
You revolted against our traditions
and left this village.

02:10:50.958 --> 02:10:54.666
And because you belong to this family
and we are your siblings,

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.375
the people here are treating us
like untouchables.

02:11:02.583 --> 02:11:06.708
Only your death can guarantee
a good future for our children.

02:11:08.791 --> 02:11:12.875
We can regain our honor in this village
by putting you to death.

02:11:42.291 --> 02:11:44.000
Shyam!

02:11:44.791 --> 02:11:46.291
Shyam!

02:11:46.875 --> 02:11:48.041
Shyam!

02:11:51.833 --> 02:11:53.833
What did you do to him? Shyam!

02:11:55.375 --> 02:11:57.791
I promised her that I would come back.

02:11:59.250 --> 02:12:00.750
Oh, God!

02:12:01.666 --> 02:12:03.416
Shyam!

02:12:04.125 --> 02:12:05.875
Shyam!

02:12:09.583 --> 02:12:11.958
I have made a mistake, Shyam!

02:12:13.541 --> 02:12:14.958
Shyam!

02:13:00.791 --> 02:13:02.083
I need to go to Kolkata.

02:14:32.416 --> 02:14:33.375
Who are you?

02:14:36.541 --> 02:14:37.416
What do you want?

02:14:37.625 --> 02:14:40.125
The press owner, Sayan Sarkar.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.125
He is my grandfather.

02:14:51.541 --> 02:14:52.541
Sarada?

02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:06.375
A dance teacher named Rosie
used to live here.

02:15:08.375 --> 02:15:09.333
Rosie?

02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:13.000
Our Rosie?

02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:18.916
Nobody came looking for Rosie
in all these years.

02:15:19.958 --> 02:15:21.416
Are you a relative of hers?

02:15:24.375 --> 02:15:26.625
I'm a very close relative of hers.

02:15:27.875 --> 02:15:30.041
There was nobody to look after the trust.

02:15:31.125 --> 02:15:32.333
Hence it was shut down.

02:15:32.625 --> 02:15:34.791
Many of them
were left in a helpless situation.

02:15:35.208 --> 02:15:38.291
Some of them chose to switch back
to their previous livelihood,

02:15:38.625 --> 02:15:40.708
for the sake of their children.

02:15:41.541 --> 02:15:46.000
A few families have managed to survive
in Sonagachi.

02:15:46.083 --> 02:15:47.875
I was very small then.

02:15:48.625 --> 02:15:50.333
I don't clearly remember,

02:15:51.125 --> 02:15:54.041
but a few days after
her husband Shyam's disappearance,

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:55.916
Rosie too left this place,

02:15:56.166 --> 02:15:57.916
and went away searching for Shyam.

02:15:58.083 --> 02:16:02.041
After that,
Emergency was declared in the nation.

02:16:02.708 --> 02:16:05.666
Vasu, we need to be in the court tomorrow.

02:16:08.708 --> 02:16:09.750
Your Honor...

02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:14.833
I'm really sorry, Your Honor.

02:16:15.708 --> 02:16:18.250
But in my career of close
to about 35 years,

02:16:18.333 --> 02:16:22.125
I've never seen something
as preposterous or as absurd as this.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:23.833
Rebirth!

02:16:25.333 --> 02:16:28.458
Finding no other way
to disprove their crime,

02:16:28.541 --> 02:16:31.375
they are presenting
such a third-rate concept in court.

02:16:31.833 --> 02:16:33.291
The accused is a filmmaker, Your Honor.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.541
He shot a video
and he is playing that as evidence.

02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:41.666
Your Honor, this isn't the 16th century.
We are in the 21st century.

02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:44.791
If we accept such videos as evidence,

02:16:44.875 --> 02:16:48.125
tomorrow someone else, claiming to be
the reincarnation of Dhirubhai Ambani,

02:16:48.208 --> 02:16:50.416
might lay claim to the ownership
of Reliance Industries.

02:16:50.708 --> 02:16:53.666
But just to humbly remind
the honorable court, Your Honor,

02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:55.833
hypnotherapy is not medically approved
in India.

02:16:55.916 --> 02:16:57.041
-Isn't it so, professor?
-Yes, but--

02:16:57.125 --> 02:16:58.416
That's it.

02:16:59.333 --> 02:17:01.500
So, Your Honor,
I will conclude with two things.

02:17:02.625 --> 02:17:05.541
Hypnosis results cannot be considered
as evidence in any case.

02:17:05.625 --> 02:17:08.166
And, the idea of reincarnation
is a superstition.

02:17:08.333 --> 02:17:11.291
There is no scientific proof for that.
That'll be all, Your Honor.

02:17:11.416 --> 02:17:13.250
With that, I rest my case. Thank you.

02:17:14.708 --> 02:17:16.000
You may leave now, ma'am.

02:17:19.625 --> 02:17:20.583
Mr. Krishnamurthy...

02:17:21.875 --> 02:17:24.291
What is that on your forehead?

02:17:24.708 --> 02:17:25.958
That's a religious mark. So?

02:17:26.041 --> 02:17:28.916
As you are a devotee of Lord Vishnu,
I don't need to remind you this.

02:17:29.291 --> 02:17:32.000
When people demanded to build
a temple in Ayodhya for Lord Rama,

02:17:32.083 --> 02:17:33.708
the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu,

02:17:34.083 --> 02:17:38.916
the Supreme Court of India
permitted them to do so,

02:17:39.041 --> 02:17:41.666
but never asked for scientific proof
for Lord Rama's existence,

02:17:42.291 --> 02:17:43.875
nor did it dismiss it as superstition.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.250
In 1939, a girl named Shanti Devi claimed
to be the reincarnation of Lugdibai.

02:17:51.333 --> 02:17:53.125
It created a sensation across the country.

02:17:53.208 --> 02:17:58.625
A 15 member committee was set up,
to find the truth behind the matter

02:17:59.250 --> 02:18:02.833
by the greatest lawyer this nation
has ever produced, Mahatma Gandhi.

02:18:03.166 --> 02:18:05.916
He didn't dismiss it as a superstition.

02:18:06.958 --> 02:18:09.250
In fact,
according to the commission's findings,

02:18:09.333 --> 02:18:11.666
Shanti Devi was indeed
a reincarnation of Lugdibai.

02:18:12.125 --> 02:18:14.666
I'm submitting the photographs
and documents related to that case.

02:18:20.833 --> 02:18:23.041
There was no scientific proof
in that case either.

02:18:24.916 --> 02:18:29.041
Similarly, my client is a reincarnation
of Shyam Singha Roy.

02:18:29.333 --> 02:18:31.166
And he rewrote his own stories.

02:18:31.541 --> 02:18:33.750
There is no copyright violation
in this case, Your Honor.

02:18:35.333 --> 02:18:38.708
Facts can be proved, but this is truth.

02:18:41.083 --> 02:18:42.333
It doesn't have any proof.

02:18:56.041 --> 02:18:58.833
The final judgment is adjourned
for tomorrow.

02:19:04.583 --> 02:19:08.291
The verdict regarding the sensational case
of Shyam Singha Roy's reincarnation

02:19:08.375 --> 02:19:10.208
is due today.

02:19:16.208 --> 02:19:18.583
After hearing the arguments
from both sides,

02:19:19.541 --> 02:19:23.375
due to the lack of logical
and scientific evidence

02:19:25.291 --> 02:19:26.750
regarding this case...

02:19:26.875 --> 02:19:28.291
Sorry, sir. A small request.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.583
-Who is he?
-He is requesting to meet you.

02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:39.583
Let him in.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.166
Considering a personal request
from someone related to this case,

02:19:45.250 --> 02:19:47.625
I hereby allow a witness
to appear in the court

02:19:47.708 --> 02:19:49.416
before the verdict is delivered.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:00.958
Uncle?

02:20:09.791 --> 02:20:10.958
It's Manoj Roy!

02:20:52.708 --> 02:20:54.041
S-Shyam.

02:20:56.958 --> 02:20:58.125
Shyam.

02:21:05.041 --> 02:21:06.416
Mr. Manoj Singha Roy,

02:21:06.708 --> 02:21:09.500
please tell the court
what you want to say about this case.

02:21:16.375 --> 02:21:19.125
Vasudev is Shyam Singha Roy.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.500
I believe that my brother, Shyam,

02:21:26.166 --> 02:21:30.250
has been reincarnated as Vasu.

02:21:30.833 --> 02:21:32.291
I firmly believe it.

02:21:39.125 --> 02:21:42.750
He is Shyam Singha Roy.

02:21:49.583 --> 02:21:51.083
What are you saying, Uncle?

02:21:53.833 --> 02:21:55.125
Silence in the court, please!

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.125
Please! Thank you.

02:21:58.833 --> 02:22:00.000
Pardon me, Your Honor.

02:22:00.375 --> 02:22:01.291
Mr. Roy...

02:22:02.875 --> 02:22:06.583
You are claiming that your brother,
Shyam, who died 45 years ago,

02:22:06.708 --> 02:22:09.291
has been reincarnated as Vasudev.

02:22:09.375 --> 02:22:11.125
You are 85 years old.

02:22:11.458 --> 02:22:12.708
It's your belief. Fine!

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:18.125
But why should I, and the honorable judge,
this court, and the public believe you?

02:22:18.333 --> 02:22:19.791
Can you give me one good reason why?

02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:24.416
Do you have any evidence to prove

02:22:24.541 --> 02:22:26.916
that Vasu did not plagiarize
Shyam Singha Roy's stories?

02:22:29.875 --> 02:22:34.541
Do you have any substantial proof
of Shyam Singha Roy's reincarnation?

02:22:34.708 --> 02:22:37.125
I'm asking you, Mr. Roy. Please tell me.
The court wants to know.

02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:38.875
Yes, I have.

02:22:39.458 --> 02:22:40.541
I have proof.

02:22:41.583 --> 02:22:44.416
A secret which
I was likely to take to my grave,

02:22:44.875 --> 02:22:47.958
the venomous side
of the Singha Roy family,

02:22:48.541 --> 02:22:51.500
has been revealed by someone in the court.

02:22:52.166 --> 02:22:54.583
I was shell-shocked by that.

02:23:07.041 --> 02:23:11.583
Anyone can plagiarize
from the published books.

02:23:11.666 --> 02:23:14.083
But there's a short story
that has never been published.

02:23:14.166 --> 02:23:17.166
And no one knows about its existence,
except for me.

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:22.250
It's a short story that Shyam Singha Roy
personally handed over to me.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.708
How could Mr. Vasudev make it
as a short film?

02:23:25.791 --> 02:23:27.666
Who gave that story to him?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:28.833
A small story.

02:23:28.916 --> 02:23:30.291
The story is...

02:23:30.958 --> 02:23:33.041
She has been passionate about painting
since her childhood.

02:23:55.708 --> 02:24:00.208
This is the only copy of that story,
written by Shyam himself.

02:24:09.166 --> 02:24:11.666
VARNAM

02:24:14.125 --> 02:24:17.125
The same story was made
as a short film by Vasudev.

02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:19.500
How is that possible?

02:24:26.708 --> 02:24:31.666
As the Chairman of SR Publishers,
I withdraw this case.

02:24:34.583 --> 02:24:37.583
Because he is not just
the owner of these three stories.

02:24:38.291 --> 02:24:40.833
He's the owner of the whole company.

02:24:43.916 --> 02:24:46.166
Since the petitioners have withdrawn
the case,

02:24:46.666 --> 02:24:49.833
the case is closed.

02:25:02.083 --> 02:25:03.833
I didn't lose, but you have won.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:05.958
Good job.

02:25:06.833 --> 02:25:08.916
I'll see you in court again. All the best.

02:25:21.458 --> 02:25:22.625
Mannu.

02:25:31.583 --> 02:25:33.416
Please forgive me, Shyam.

02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:36.166
I was responsible for your death.

02:25:38.166 --> 02:25:42.041
I didn't know that our brothers
would do that to you.

02:25:43.875 --> 02:25:45.208
You were very stubborn.

02:25:46.583 --> 02:25:48.250
That's why you are born again.

02:25:53.250 --> 02:25:55.083
Your stories found their way back to you.

02:25:55.833 --> 02:25:57.583
Your stories saved you.

02:25:59.916 --> 02:26:03.625
This company, all the assets...
It all belongs to you.

02:26:04.666 --> 02:26:05.666
Take it.

02:26:07.208 --> 02:26:08.750
What should I do with them?

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.666
I promised Rosie
that I would spend a lifetime with her.

02:26:18.208 --> 02:26:19.791
But I left her midway.

02:26:23.666 --> 02:26:26.500
Rosie must have waited for me
until her last breath.

02:26:31.041 --> 02:26:33.041
I don't know why I was reborn.

02:26:38.250 --> 02:26:39.208
Rosie...

02:26:40.583 --> 02:26:42.250
Rosie is alive.

02:26:45.708 --> 02:26:47.958
She is waiting for you.

02:26:50.166 --> 02:26:51.250
You mean, Rosie...

02:26:52.125 --> 02:26:53.916
Is very much alive.

02:26:55.666 --> 02:26:57.875
I hid her in my uncle's village.

02:26:58.666 --> 02:27:01.708
I asked her to live with us
after our brothers passed away.

02:27:02.291 --> 02:27:03.708
But she refused.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.458
SHYAMA DANCE SCHOOL

02:27:22.541 --> 02:27:24.541
She is strong-willed.

02:27:28.666 --> 02:27:30.666
That's why you have been born again.

02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:37.833
I guess, I'm still alive
only to pass on this news to you.

02:30:59.416 --> 02:31:02.750
I want to die on a new moon day like this,
lying on your lap,

02:31:03.375 --> 02:31:07.541
staring at you in my last moments
with a smile on my lips.

02:31:10.166 --> 02:31:11.500
That's my final wish.

02:32:33.541 --> 02:32:34.916
Come away with me, Rosie.
