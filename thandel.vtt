00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:15.541
BUJJI THALLI

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.416
Please, Raju.
Don't go fishing.

00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:24.791
I won't leave you.

00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.041
- Promise?
- I won't. Okay?

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.500
The storm shows no signs of letting up.
Pile them up in the storage deck.

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.416
You promised!
What's this?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.750
As soon as I return from fishing,
we'll get married.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:44.583
Daddha, the waves are getting stronger.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:45.916
Turn the boats around, now!

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.375
If you're leaving now,
it's not just to go fishing.

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:52.875
You're leaving me for good.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.416
Hey, Raju!
Think again!

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:27.208
Sathya?

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.125
What's this, dear?

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.125
Let's go home, dear.

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.541
- Dad.
- Yes, dear?

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:41.500
Find a groom for me.

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:44.500
What did you say?

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.666
You know I think carefully
before making decisions.

00:05:57.583 --> 00:05:59.208
Not the studs, sister.
Give me the hangings.

00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:04.541
What is it?

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:09.000
When he wasn't in the village,
I didn't care about how I looked.

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.250
When he was around,
I wanted to look the way he liked.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.708
But now that
he's no longer in my life,

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:19.083
I feel like looking my absolute best.

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:20.291
Are you angry with him?

00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:24.041
When there's no love,
how can there be any anger, sister?

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:29.583
{\an8}So, what does
the groom do for a living?

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:31.041
The name is Murali.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.375
Do you know
there's a finance company in our village?

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.625
He's working as
a recovery agent for them.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:40.750
As a recovery agent,
he collects monthly installments.

00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:42.708
If not, he confiscates the goods.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:45.375
{\an8}What's all this
fuss about recovery

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:46.500
when we're heading
for a wedding proposal?

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:48.875
{\an8}- First, hold on to it tight.
- Keep going.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.333
What is it?
What are we waiting for?

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:54.500
Please call the girl quickly.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:55.791
I can't stay patient any longer.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.958
I have a few recoveries
to complete. I need to go.

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:06.416
Wow!

00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.000
She's so beautiful!

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.000
Does my face deserve
such a good-looking girl?

00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:15.333
She must have been
pressured into this meeting.

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:17.458
This won't work out anyway.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.875
Please sit.

00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:20.416
Sit down.

00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.541
If you need some privacy,
go over there. We're okay with it.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:25.875
- Dad.
- You have something to say?

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.708
- I agree to this wedding.
- Sathya!

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:31.958
That's good!

00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:35.333
Clearly, the groom is double okay.
Look at him gape.

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:37.750
Let's hurry up then, brother-in-law.

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:40.833
Hand us your daughter's horoscope
and we'll fix an auspicious date.

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:41.791
Sure.

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.125
Hey! What are you saying, Dad?

00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:45.166
Have you seen me?

00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.958
In seven generations of our family line,

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:49.875
has there ever been a girl
as beautiful as her?

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:54.875
The horoscopes must have matched,
that's why the girl agreed.

00:07:57.666 --> 00:08:00.125
No matching the horoscopes, etc.
Let's fix the wedding straight away!

00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:24.625
Isn't your Shiva mighty?

00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:28.583
Is it true your heart's desire gets
fulfilled the moment you wish for it?

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.833
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:33.666
Why did you want to meet?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.750
I need to tell you something.

00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:38.208
Sure. Go ahead.
Just say it.

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:40.750
His name is Raju.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:45.916
There you go!

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.208
I was wondering how everything
surprisingly fell into place!

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.416
You agreed to the wedding
and got me flying into heaven.

00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.416
With just a word "Raju,"
you brought me down like that.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.083
But I will marry you.

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:00.750
What are you saying?

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.708
Please be clear.

00:09:04.208 --> 00:09:05.916
For you to understand…

00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:08.791
I'll have to elaborate.

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:15.250
{\an8}As wages are high,
our men travel 2000 kilometers

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.958
from our village, D. Matchilesam,
to the Gujarat port

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:20.291
on contracts to catch fish
for nine months.

00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:23.916
After one month of fishing,
they reach the port

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:27.375
{\an8}and hand over the lot to the owner
before returning to the sea.

00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:30.125
During this one month at sea,

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:31.750
they won't even have
proper network connectivity.

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:36.000
Alright, go ahead.
Check this out, guys.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.833
For this fishing season,
he is the Thandel.

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:38.750
Daddha.

00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.416
What happened?

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:46.875
Oh my God, they caught us!

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.625
We're dead.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.500
The recovery guys are coming.

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.750
Here comes the nasty gang to loot us!

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.083
We either have to hand over the stock
or part with 50,000 rupees.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.041
- We can't escape this time.
- Just wait.

00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:03.000
Hey, Raju!

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:06.625
He's in his own world.

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.958
{\an8}He is waiting for Sathya's call!

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.833
{\an8}He is totally lost in his mobile.

00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:16.125
{\an8}Why would he care about
the stuff on the boat?

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:06.500
Come on, have it.

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.000
Hey!

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:11.375
His phone is out of coverage. Not yours.

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:12.458
Don't worry.

00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:13.833
He'll call you anyway.

00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.458
- Brother! Brother!
- Brother! Brother!

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:50.750
- Please wait, brother.
- Please, brother.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.916
Give me the money,
or part with the load.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.250
This is our final hunt, brother.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.541
- These are just boys. Please leave them.
- Hey!

00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:58.250
Get the load!

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.750
- Brother! Please leave us this one time.
- Please, brother.

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:02.791
- Please, brother. Just once…
- Just wait.

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:08.625
- No, brother.
- Brother, wait!

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.875
My precious.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.375
My precious!

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:43.250
My precious?

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:47.375
My precious?

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.375
Raju!

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.083
My…

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:53.291
Raju!

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:57.541
- Raju!
- Hey! You…

00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:01.750
{\an8}Raju?

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.666
Hey, Raju.

00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:15.708
My precious!

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.375
Hey, Raju.

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:20.583
Tell me. What's up?

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:24.041
What's this, Raju? You called after
so long and won't even speak.

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.708
The signal tower is troubling me.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.250
- So, I'm setting it up.
- What?

00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:35.000
- Setting up?
- Yes, my precious.

00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:47.791
How dare you touch my Bhavani?
You scoundrel!

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.708
What's wrong, Raju?

00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:57.416
Can't you wait to die?

00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:06.208
More than the unstable signal,
it's you troubling me without talking.

00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:11.916
Raju!

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:12.958
Raju!

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:20.583
Please be on the line for a minute, dear.
Without speaking.

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:28.083
Steer the boat to the jetty, Daddha.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.458
Let's rock this show!

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:08.458
Daddha, forget a rupee,

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:11.833
not even a little fish
must leave this boat.

00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:23.000
After a month's fishing,

00:15:23.083 --> 00:15:25.625
this is the first time
we're hearing his voice.

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.583
I'd spend a month
just to hear him speak this one day.

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:33.833
My precious one.

00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:38.083
It's so refreshing to have
a hot water bath.

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:40.458
Raju, tell me something.

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:42.583
Do you like taking a hot water bath

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.041
or spending time with me?

00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:46.875
I'd enjoy it even more
if you were the one bathing me.

00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:47.833
Gosh!

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:51.083
What are you saying, Raju?

00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:52.416
If Dad hears…

00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:16.041
Despite the countless distances
We've traveled together

00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:18.625
I'm never tired of this journey

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:24.291
Despite the countless shores
That lie between us

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:26.958
They are no obstacles at all

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:32.583
Time flies when I'm with you
It's so unjust when you're away!

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:36.708
Even the second hand on the clock
Slowed to an hour's pace!

00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:38.750
With you, time melts away

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:40.875
Without you
Even the dates on the calendar

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.541
Seem to stand still
As if it's been a year

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:47.875
Oh my love, my love!

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:52.666
I turned my ship's sail towards you, dear!

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.125
Oh my love, my love!

00:16:56.833 --> 00:17:02.125
I adorned myself
Awaiting your arrival

00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:22.708
I will soar through the skies
And sail through the clouds

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:26.750
Until I rest in your embrace
I'll be restless

00:17:26.833 --> 00:17:31.000
Adorned in hues so bright
Dazzled by spots

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:35.041
Until I see you
My eyes cannot sleep

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:39.333
{\an8}Your words sound like
The waves crashing to me

00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:43.000
This gentle breeze touches me
Like your call

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:46.791
You totally refrain from eating meat
when he's away for nine months.

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:48.333
You don't even eat eggs.

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:52.791
- How do you control your urge?
- I'll eat again when Raju comes back.

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.041
What kind of romance is this?

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:58.458
Not eating while he's away,
hoisting a flag on the lighthouse…

00:17:58.541 --> 00:17:59.458
What nonsense!

00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:00.791
It's not like that.

00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:04.583
We've seen a lot of regret from childhood.

00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:07.375
While I was away for my studies,

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:10.000
I used to visit the village
only once every six months.

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.208
He's been away for nine months,
occupied with fishing.

00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:14.708
That's the reason for this romance.

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:16.375
What is this boss?

00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:18.583
What will I tell my guys
if you pay so less?

00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:21.541
What are you worried about?

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.875
I'll take care of it.

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:25.375
As soon as I return,
we'll eat only in hotels.

00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:28.208
- What do you talk about for so long?
- We'll dress up nicely.

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:30.208
- Just hang up and sleep off.
- Buzz off.

00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:31.750
What time will you arrive?

00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:33.416
Eight more hours, dear.

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:35.750
Raju, just eight more hours!

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:37.250
I can't wait to see you.

00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:56.375
- Hey, Lachi. Give the bag to Mom.
- Okay, bro.

00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:58.291
- What about the payment?
- I'll distribute it later.

00:18:58.375 --> 00:18:59.625
- What's with him?
- It's love!

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:05.541
Oh my love, my love!

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:10.500
I turned my ship sails towards you, dear!

00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:14.208
Oh my love, my love!

00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:18.958
I adorned myself
Awaiting your arrival!

00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:19.875
Hey!

00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:22.541
The three months I spend here
are equal to nine months for me.

00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.833
That means each day
counts as three days.

00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:28.541
My God! We shouldn't leave a gap.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.708
Let's get wild!

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:32.916
Aunty, leave it.

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:36.708
I brought hot water.
What are you looking at?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.875
Give him a bath.

00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:41.708
You wouldn't like it if I did.
Besides, we have plenty of time for that.

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:43.833
Oh, wow!
What is it?

00:21:44.458 --> 00:21:45.458
Why are you glowing like that?

00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:50.291
It feels like I'm dying
And I swear on you

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:54.250
When you, in my dreams
Appear before my eyes

00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:58.583
As if there is no difference
Between the earth and the sky

00:21:58.666 --> 00:22:02.583
I could walk among the stars
With you by my side

00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:06.791
Can there be true love
Without any challenges?

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:08.958
Only after enduring this pain

00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:10.458
We can appreciate the sweetness of love

00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:13.958
{\an8}Oh my dear, my dear!

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.625
I've sailed across oceans for you, dear!

00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:23.083
Oh my dear, my dear!

00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:27.958
{\an8}I've poured all my love for you, dear!

00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:53.583
Hey, Rambabu.

00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:55.625
They're long dead.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.083
They aren't going anywhere.
Eat slowly.

00:22:58.291 --> 00:22:59.375
Or you might choke.

00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:00.333
Yes, darling.

00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.958
You're a big fan of meat, aren't you?

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:06.041
Why do you vow
to give it up until I return?

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.125
I won't from now on.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.166
I'm unable to stop myself
from eating meat.

00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:11.666
- Have it.
- This is the final time.

00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:22.916
Raju is just like his father, Veerayya.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.875
He was a leader
to all the fishermen in our village.

00:23:27.458 --> 00:23:30.208
He lived for his people
and also died for them.

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:33.125
Raju took after his father.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.833
He believed that if the woman of the house
took charge, the home would thrive.

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:39.833
He'd hand over every penny
he earned from fishing to the womenfolk.

00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:44.041
He'd stand strong
whenever his team faced challenges.

00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:51.166
- Daddha!
- Give me a quarter.

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:54.208
Here you go.

00:23:57.791 --> 00:23:58.875
What's wrong with Daddha?

00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:19.208
What's wrong, Daddha?

00:24:21.041 --> 00:24:24.500
They stopped fishing in
our neighboring Munugudu

00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:26.875
and began mining sand instead.

00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:34.291
The contractor gave a bribe
and secured the government's permission.

00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.708
- We got the permission to mine here.
- Sir, you know very well

00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:44.166
what happened when you mined sand
where you shouldn't have.

00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:47.166
- The entire vil--
- The entire village drowned.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.291
You should've taken measures
to save your lives.

00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:51.666
I'll pay compensation when lives are lost.

00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:53.458
Now go away.

00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:55.583
He doesn't care about our lives.

00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:02.875
It feels so humiliating that
I don't want to be called a leader.

00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:09.000
He undermined our dignity.
He dishonored our place.

00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:11.458
After letting go of all of this…

00:25:11.791 --> 00:25:14.875
What do we know?
We don't know anything.

00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:17.625
He even mocked our dialect!

00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:24.666
Your worthless lives,
and your broken accent.

00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:30.041
Even after the entire village
begged him,

00:25:30.791 --> 00:25:33.125
he spoke in a demeaning way
about our profession.

00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:39.125
Get lost!
You losers!

00:25:57.458 --> 00:25:58.625
Guys, come on!

00:27:19.416 --> 00:27:20.250
Dear.

00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:21.791
I'll take care of it, dear.

00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:28.375
Your son?

00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:32.416
The taste of water
changes with the region,

00:27:33.083 --> 00:27:38.250
the smell of soil shifts, the wind,
and even the accent and language.

00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:41.208
That's what defines us.

00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:44.750
They're as pure as a mother's love.

00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:48.833
My father told me this
when I was ten years old.

00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:53.000
He must be over thirty now.

00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:55.416
Doesn't he even know how to say this much?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.083
If this is how it is with Munugudu…

00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:03.250
imagine what it'll be like
if it reaches Matchilesam!

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:06.291
A festival of chaos!

00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:12.125
Raju's speech about our community's
survival and roots

00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:13.583
touched everyone in the village.

00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:18.625
They decided to shape Raju's legacy
to be as remarkable as Veeranna's.

00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:22.750
A true leader is someone who sees
the village's problems as their own.

00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:25.041
In our language, "Thandel."

00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:28.458
Raju stood strong for
each one of us today.

00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:32.625
By tradition, this festival crowned
Raju's father and me

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.208
as the Thandel of this village.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.583
From now on…

00:28:38.708 --> 00:28:40.000
Raju is our Thandel!

00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:10.916
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:29:13.791 --> 00:29:17.333
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:30.250
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:34.000
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.666
Hey, hear the crazy rhythm!

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.333
Beating the damaru aloud

00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:53.541
Shake the eight directions
O Lord of Dance!

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:56.958
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:58.500
Start with the rhythmic beat!

00:29:58.583 --> 00:30:00.250
Pour out your elixir

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:03.458
Let my heart be as pure as silver
O Lord Kundaleshwara

00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.875
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:30:06.958 --> 00:30:10.125
All hail Lord Shiva!
Hail, hail, hail to Shiva!

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:13.541
Open your third eye
And burn down our sins

00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:16.791
All hail Lord Shankara!
Shiva Shiva Shiva Shankara!

00:30:16.875 --> 00:30:20.000
Twirl your trident
And show us the right path

00:30:20.083 --> 00:30:23.250
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:26.625
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:29.791
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:33.583
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:09.458
You're the first lover
Is there a match?

00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:13.041
There's no one in this world
Who can come close to you

00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:16.166
The desires of millions
Of your devotees

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:19.708
Are fulfilled by you, yourself

00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:22.833
For Mother Parvati,
You gave half of your body

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:26.125
O Ruler of the Cosmos!

00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:29.625
You shield us from all sorrow
You're our constant companion

00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:32.750
You are the best husband
O Maheshwara!

00:31:33.083 --> 00:31:36.000
You're the beginning
You're at the end

00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:39.541
You're the protector
At all times

00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:42.750
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:46.458
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:03.041
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:06.625
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:07.375 --> 00:32:10.666
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.083
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:17.416
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.625
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:20.708 --> 00:32:24.125
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:27.458
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:30.833
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:34.166
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.708
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:40.916
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.666
Salutations, salutations
Salutations to Shiva!

00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:55.958
- Sathya, come here!
- Raju, come on!

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:57.166
- Let's cut the cake.
- Come here.

00:32:59.875 --> 00:33:00.916
Here you go, dear.

00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:02.333
- Cut the cake.
- Cut the cake, dear.

00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:08.375
This is your gift till your birthday.

00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:10.708
Look at it tick away!

00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:12.916
- Don't listen to him. Let's go.
- What's this, Chandra?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.875
I'm talking here.
Why are you dragging her away?

00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:16.625
Stop with your useless gifts.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.708
You flatter her and then head off to work!

00:33:18.916 --> 00:33:20.708
I'll have to deal with her
for the next nine months.

00:33:20.791 --> 00:33:22.541
Sister, it's her birthday.

00:33:22.708 --> 00:33:24.750
Brother-in-law only gets
three months with her.

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:25.708
Shut up!

00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:27.166
He'll pamper her now and leave.

00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:30.416
Later, I'll be dealing with
her tantrums and health issues.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.916
You won't understand now.
Just wait until you marry Raju.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.416
- You'll know what it feels like.
- Chandra!

00:33:48.208 --> 00:33:50.541
- How's it going, brother?
- Brother, you've had enough. Give me some.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.166
- Leave her alone.
- Sister!

00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:54.083
It's done.
Don't make that face now.

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:58.541
Why don't you share a drink with brother?
Everything will fall into place.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.625
She used to be worried even when
I went fishing from the village.

00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:08.750
When her brother-in-law is going
fishing for months together,

00:34:09.458 --> 00:34:12.041
you can understand how she'd feel.

00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.458
Here comes your call.
Go on.

00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:26.333
Not just the movie,
we're also going to buy cotton.

00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:31.250
Dear…

00:34:32.458 --> 00:34:34.125
you go to bed early as it is.

00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:36.250
It's getting late.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:39.750
Look at your eyelids drooping.

00:34:40.875 --> 00:34:42.250
You're sleepy. Go to bed.

00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:44.208
Hey…

00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:46.625
I wanted to stay up all night
talking to you.

00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:48.375
But you're asking me to sleep.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.000
Don't you like spending time with me?

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:52.458
I love it.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.708
You're always the same.

00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:56.916
You keep saying this
and that about your friends,

00:34:57.625 --> 00:34:59.791
and disappear while I'm talking.

00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:02.708
You don't love me at all!

00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:08.541
Oh my love, my love!

00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:14.833
Oh my love…

00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:39.958
Thandel!

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.750
Dear Raju…

00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:56.166
this is our pride.

00:37:03.416 --> 00:37:04.875
Jai Durga Bhavani.

00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:07.291
This is our courage.

00:37:12.625 --> 00:37:13.958
- Hello?
- Raju.

00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:15.666
I'm going in, my precious.

00:37:16.208 --> 00:37:17.125
The signal will drop.

00:37:17.708 --> 00:37:19.958
- My precious!
- At least talk to me until then.

00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:25.875
- Raju, tell me something.
- What?

00:37:26.208 --> 00:37:29.083
How can you go so many days
without talking to me or seeing me?

00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:30.791
Don't you miss me at all?

00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:38.958
I spend a month at sea

00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:41.791
just to talk to you for a day.

00:37:43.666 --> 00:37:45.458
For those three months I'm with you,

00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:48.250
I'd happily endure nine months.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.416
My precious.

00:37:54.333 --> 00:37:55.208
My precious?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.250
Hello? Raju?

00:37:57.333 --> 00:37:58.166
- My precious…
- Raju?

00:37:58.875 --> 00:38:00.125
- Raju?
- Can you hear me?

00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:02.041
My precious?

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:06.000
Raju?

00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:40.833
Mom?

00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:42.291
Mom?

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:44.625
- Chandra…
- Hello, Mom?

00:38:45.291 --> 00:38:46.458
- Chandra…
- What's wrong, Mom?

00:38:48.166 --> 00:38:49.083
What happened, Mom?

00:38:49.208 --> 00:38:50.208
Brother…

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.375
What?

00:38:52.125 --> 00:38:53.083
Brother…

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.375
What happened to him?

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.708
All of us were catching fish.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.958
All of a sudden,
their boat capsized.

00:39:35.416 --> 00:39:37.208
We couldn't find them anywhere.

00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:39.833
It was strange.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.291
They floated at a distance after an hour.

00:39:58.208 --> 00:40:01.750
I don't know how to console you, sister.

00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:04.333
Don't stay like this.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:11.958
How can you possibly console me?

00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:16.000
It was Dhana today.
Tomorrow, it'll be me. And then, you.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.166
Everyone is destined to die.

00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:22.416
But us?

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.958
We take death head-on.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.333
Get used to such a life
from now on, Sathya.

00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:04.958
What's it, dear?

00:41:05.458 --> 00:41:06.541
Unable to sleep?

00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:08.500
You attended a funeral.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.041
It's okay to feel like that.

00:41:10.416 --> 00:41:12.083
Dad, clarify one thing for me.

00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:13.500
Those born into our caste

00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:15.583
are expected to go out for fishing, right?

00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:19.708
Then why do you always
stay back at home stitching nets?

00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:22.125
Why don't you go out
fishing in the ocean?

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:26.916
What is it, Dad?

00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:28.541
Why won't you say anything?

00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:33.333
I used to go fishing as well, dear.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.125
I was crazy about fishing.

00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:41.458
Like Veerayya, Raju's father,
I also wanted to become a leader.

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:44.208
Both of us had this competitive streak.

00:41:48.333 --> 00:41:49.958
One day, we went fishing…

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.666
and came back home…

00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:53.208
Saraswathi!

00:41:55.125 --> 00:41:56.083
Saraswathi!

00:41:57.333 --> 00:41:59.125
Forget about Saraswathi, Somaiah.

00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:00.625
She died from a heart attack.

00:42:07.833 --> 00:42:09.583
Forget seeing your mom
for one last time,

00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:12.250
I couldn't even recognize
her final resting place.

00:42:14.375 --> 00:42:15.250
Gowramma.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.625
She used to let you sleep in her home.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.541
If I went fishing,

00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:26.083
who would take care of you, dear?

00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:27.166
That's why

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.500
I stopped going fishing from that day.

00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.875
But in Raju's case,

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:36.916
why didn't you stop me, Dad?

00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:40.833
My wish is that you don't marry him.

00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:44.750
But marrying him is your wish.

00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:47.000
Even now,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.125
I'm leaving the choice to you, dear.

00:42:51.916 --> 00:42:56.291
I hope Raju doesn't remain
just in people's memories like his father.

00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:57.875
And like Raju's mother,

00:42:57.958 --> 00:42:59.916
I don't want you to be
stuck living in memories.

00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:20.208
- My precious!
- You always came back in thirty days.

00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:22.000
Why are you late by six days this time?

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.291
Do you know how my hands tremble
once I'm done applying the kohl?

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.958
You're the leader, right?
You could have returned earlier.

00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:30.125
What's wrong with you, dear?

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:31.916
Why are you restless?

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:33.958
Are you missing me?

00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:35.916
Come soon, Raju.

00:43:36.416 --> 00:43:37.416
I'm worried.

00:43:37.708 --> 00:43:40.916
Alright, don't worry.
We'll start tonight.

00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:57.916
Rajesh looks skilled with the net.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.458
- This time, hunting would be awesome.
- Raju!

00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.041
Raju, will you give me your word?

00:44:10.708 --> 00:44:11.875
Just my word?

00:44:11.958 --> 00:44:14.375
- I'll give you my life.
- Please don't say that.

00:44:14.833 --> 00:44:15.875
Hearing that makes my heart race.

00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:18.125
What's bothering you?

00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:19.833
What happened?

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.208
- Shekar brother went fishing and…
- I got the news.

00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:25.458
Is that the cause of your worry?

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:27.583
Don't worry.

00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:30.000
Come on, my precious.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.833
As soon as I reached the village,
we would excitedly run for the flag.

00:44:32.916 --> 00:44:34.916
Now, we're walking without enthusiasm.

00:44:41.541 --> 00:44:42.416
Raju…

00:44:43.833 --> 00:44:45.041
I wanted to ask you something.

00:44:47.833 --> 00:44:50.375
Before that, I've got to share
something with you.

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:56.333
As usual, the boss withheld
seven months of wages.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.458
I don't understand what he gains
by holding onto our hard-earned money.

00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:01.833
Well, let him do that.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.625
But he gave us a boat
for the next fishing trip.

00:45:06.333 --> 00:45:10.708
I'm not sure how to express
this growing fear inside me.

00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:16.000
The way you look
when you wear this color, my dear…

00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:17.708
Just great!

00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:19.875
Stop praising me.

00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:22.833
Will you always stay around
for me to wear new clothes every day?

00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:24.875
Our lives are measured
in nine months and three months.

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:31.958
I'm so happy, even if Raju
is here for only three months.

00:45:32.291 --> 00:45:33.500
What if he stays for the whole year?

00:45:33.625 --> 00:45:36.250
- It feels so great.
- Not at all.

00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:38.541
Aren't you worried?

00:45:38.916 --> 00:45:40.875
What do you mean?
A man has to work!

00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:43.041
- Here we go again.
- How else will he provide?

00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:44.791
Yes, enjoy it all by yourself!

00:45:50.125 --> 00:45:51.041
Dear.

00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:53.916
Come, sit here.

00:45:57.041 --> 00:45:58.583
I tried every possible way.

00:45:59.541 --> 00:46:02.125
He doesn't understand why I'm like this.

00:46:02.666 --> 00:46:04.875
And I have no idea how to tell him.

00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:09.125
Ask him directly. He'll agree.

00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:12.041
When has he ever said no to you?

00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:24.041
My dear…

00:46:25.041 --> 00:46:26.833
see how fast the days have passed.

00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:29.833
Don't be like this, please.

00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:32.541
I can't handle this, Raju.

00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:35.458
Ever since what happened
to Chandrakka's family

00:46:35.958 --> 00:46:37.208
I've been feeling terrified.

00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:39.958
Please, Raju, don't go fishing.

00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:41.833
Why say this all of a sudden?

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.208
Such things happen. So what?

00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:47.833
You can't just stay home.

00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:50.125
Please, Raju, don't go.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.750
Think whatever you want.

00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:53.291
I can't live without you.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.083
Look.

00:46:55.166 --> 00:46:57.458
I've spent three months of your stay
here with so much joy.

00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:59.625
But during the nine months you go fishing,

00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:03.541
the fear of something happening
to you eats at me.

00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:05.125
Forget all of this.

00:47:06.125 --> 00:47:08.625
To be honest, the last month…

00:47:09.666 --> 00:47:11.625
is more painful than childbirth, Raju.

00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:14.458
Please understand my fear, Raju.

00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:15.916
Don't go.

00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:20.791
So this is why you've been
silent and upset all these days?

00:47:23.416 --> 00:47:24.375
My dear.

00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:27.666
Death can take anyone, even at home.

00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:30.166
I'm Thandel Raju now.

00:47:31.125 --> 00:47:33.791
I'm stronger at sea than I'm on land.

00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.750
Even if the boat sinks, this Raju won't.

00:47:39.458 --> 00:47:41.500
I've been fishing for ten years.

00:47:41.583 --> 00:47:43.583
Look, has anything
ever happened till now?

00:47:43.666 --> 00:47:46.166
- Why are you scared?
- Don't. No, Raju!

00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:48.791
No matter what courage
you talk about, you're not going!

00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:50.041
Stay back!

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:51.916
Come, sit.

00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:54.291
Dear…

00:47:55.458 --> 00:47:56.375
don't be like that.

00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.250
Please don't be like that.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.083
Alright. I'll always stay with you.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.333
Dear.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.125
Okay, I won't go.
Please don't be like that.

00:48:06.625 --> 00:48:08.666
- I won't leave you.
- Really?

00:48:09.708 --> 00:48:11.333
- I won't leave you.
- Promise?

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.375
- Really?
- I said I won't leave.

00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:21.458
Smile now.

00:48:21.916 --> 00:48:22.791
Just smile!

00:48:28.708 --> 00:48:31.000
Why isn't Raju answering my calls?

00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:32.625
Maybe he's with his girl.

00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:34.125
Three months is fine.

00:48:34.291 --> 00:48:37.000
But if you stay back for the entire year,
what am I supposed to do with you?

00:48:44.708 --> 00:48:47.375
Raju, come to the station
by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:48.541
- Alright?
- Okay.

00:48:49.666 --> 00:48:52.208
Did you tell your friends
that you aren't going?

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:56.333
Why are you silent?

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.500
Don't start stressing
about finding work tomorrow.

00:49:02.208 --> 00:49:03.750
Work will come to you, just wait and see.

00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:05.583
No matter where you are,
you're always the king.

00:49:10.875 --> 00:49:12.833
I don't have to stop eating meat.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.208
We can go wherever we want.

00:49:16.833 --> 00:49:17.875
Raju, tell me one thing.

00:49:18.625 --> 00:49:21.500
Should we keep this phone
or throw it away?

00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:23.750
We have nothing to do with it anymore.

00:49:26.916 --> 00:49:27.833
My precious.

00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:30.375
Are you falling asleep?

00:49:30.958 --> 00:49:33.250
Yes, dear.
My eyes are getting heavy.

00:49:37.625 --> 00:49:38.541
Alright, sleep well.

00:49:39.583 --> 00:49:41.083
Hold me tightly.

00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:03.666
Everyone, hurry up!

00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:06.916
- What's going on?
- I'm coming too, Uncle.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:07.916
Are you tagging along?

00:51:08.791 --> 00:51:10.791
- What's this, Daddha?
- Actually, Suri…

00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:13.000
What can we say?

00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:15.666
His dad is greedy
for even a single day's wages.

00:51:16.333 --> 00:51:19.166
He isn't listening to us.
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:22.791
Alright, come on.
Let's rock! Okay?

00:51:28.416 --> 00:51:31.375
Hey, load up fast!
Quit loitering around.

00:51:33.375 --> 00:51:34.291
Raju!

00:51:34.916 --> 00:51:35.750
Raju!

00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:38.833
Alright then. See you.

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.375
Raju!

00:51:42.125 --> 00:51:43.208
You promised!

00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:44.500
- What are you doing?
- My precious.

00:51:45.166 --> 00:51:47.583
I thought you'd understand
what I meant. I said it casually.

00:51:48.041 --> 00:51:50.583
Understand, my foot!
I don't need all that.

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.625
Just tell me, are you
staying with me or not?

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.625
Fine, dear. Let's step aside
and talk. Everyone's here.

00:51:56.708 --> 00:51:57.958
I don't care about them!

00:51:58.208 --> 00:51:59.583
Are you staying or not?

00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:01.708
Come here.

00:52:03.083 --> 00:52:05.875
All these years,
I've been going and returning.

00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:08.708
Has anything bad ever happened?

00:52:09.583 --> 00:52:10.500
Look…

00:52:11.041 --> 00:52:14.375
after this trip, we'll get married.

00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:16.333
I'm the Thandel!

00:52:16.458 --> 00:52:20.166
I have to go. Just smile
and send me off this time.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.375
Please, dear.

00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:25.375
If you're leaving now,
it's not just for fishing.

00:52:25.875 --> 00:52:27.416
You're leaving me for good.

00:52:29.291 --> 00:52:32.208
- Why are you saying such things?
- Because that's how I feel.

00:52:32.708 --> 00:52:33.583
What now?

00:52:33.708 --> 00:52:35.625
Are you worried about losing
your title and honor?

00:52:46.291 --> 00:52:48.458
I have 21 people relying on me
as their leader.

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.541
And through them, 70 more
in our village depend on me.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.875
To keep them fed for 12 months,

00:52:56.916 --> 00:52:58.875
we have to work for nine.

00:53:00.875 --> 00:53:02.375
I don't care about all that!

00:53:03.791 --> 00:53:04.708
It's either me or Thandel!

00:53:07.166 --> 00:53:10.083
To me, nothing in this world
matters more than you!

00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:15.666
Every time I return, I come to see you,
even before visiting my mother.

00:53:17.541 --> 00:53:18.791
Then why don't you stay back?

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.208
Stay back, Raju.

00:53:20.791 --> 00:53:21.708
Please.

00:53:21.833 --> 00:53:22.708
Just for me.

00:53:27.375 --> 00:53:28.250
Raju.

00:53:29.666 --> 00:53:30.625
Swear on me.

00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:32.041
I'm asking for the last time.

00:53:32.666 --> 00:53:34.166
Are you staying or leaving?

00:53:38.875 --> 00:53:40.500
I can't stay back.

00:53:46.208 --> 00:53:47.708
Don't cry, dear.

00:53:59.958 --> 00:54:01.583
I can't bear to see you like this.

00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:05.083
- Please, just smile once.
- Bro, the train's leaving! Hurry up!

00:54:06.333 --> 00:54:09.541
You always send me off with a smile.

00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:10.750
I can't bear to see you like this.

00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:15.791
- Just this once, dear.
- Brother, time's up! Come on!

00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:16.750
Why is he not coming?

00:54:17.875 --> 00:54:20.708
- Dear, the train is moving.
- She'll calm down and call, brother.

00:54:20.791 --> 00:54:22.125
Get in! I'm coming!

00:54:22.208 --> 00:54:23.708
Everyone, go!
Daddha, get in!

00:54:24.416 --> 00:54:27.291
Darling, listen to me.
The train is leaving.

00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:28.583
- Come fast, Raju!
- Come on!

00:54:28.708 --> 00:54:30.958
They all trust me.
I can't leave them.

00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:32.750
- Please understand. I'll call you.
- Raju!

00:54:34.125 --> 00:54:36.041
- Please don't feel bad, dear.
- Hey!

00:54:36.125 --> 00:54:37.625
- I'll call you as soon as I get off.
- Come on!

00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:39.500
- Raju!
- Don't give me that look.

00:54:39.583 --> 00:54:42.625
- Hurry up!
- We'll speak on the phone. Right away!

00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:49.750
Don't be like that, my precious!
I'll be back soon!

00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:52.916
Hey, smile a little!

00:55:08.458 --> 00:55:09.333
Darling…

00:55:09.958 --> 00:55:11.041
you're a part of me.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.875
We're not apart.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.333
How can I say I like you
this much and that much?

00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:21.083
Not hollow words.
Give me a straight answer.

00:55:21.333 --> 00:55:24.875
- How much do you like me?
- Who is speaking hollow words?

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:48.875
No, dear.

00:56:42.541 --> 00:56:45.833
Like a flickering flame in the wind

00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:51.541
My soul sways yearning to reach you

00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:55.708
Like the moon
Cloaked in stormy clouds

00:56:56.458 --> 00:57:00.750
My world darkens
Without a word from you

00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:05.625
Like a boat caught in the whirlwind
Rising and falling

00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:09.625
I'm struggling to stand straight

00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:11.250
Just for you

00:57:12.625 --> 00:57:16.208
My soul awaits

00:57:16.875 --> 00:57:18.916
O precious

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.666
Just for me

00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:25.541
Speak a single word

00:57:26.125 --> 00:57:28.916
My precious

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.958
Is the net strong enough, my precious?

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:38.833
I'm asking you…

00:57:40.333 --> 00:57:42.625
Alright. I got it.

00:57:42.833 --> 00:57:45.750
I cannot call you "my precious." Right?

00:57:52.208 --> 00:57:54.333
Like a fish without water

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.541
Like a sky without stars

00:57:56.791 --> 00:58:01.166
Where's life within me
Without your words?

00:58:01.375 --> 00:58:05.791
This time, I'll come right on time
Fall at your feet for my crime

00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:10.375
I'll slap myself, my heart will grieve
I promise you, I'll never leave

00:58:10.625 --> 00:58:15.166
I can conquer the tides of a salty sea

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:19.083
But drown in tears you shed for me

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.125
My precious!
There's one bar of signal left.

00:58:26.208 --> 00:58:27.083
Say something.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.291
Please, just say something, dear!

00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:33.083
At least say, "Raju," and hang up.
That will keep me going for a month.

00:58:33.416 --> 00:58:36.500
Darling! Can you hear me?
Please say something!

00:58:36.708 --> 00:58:38.416
Why are you punishing me
with your silence?

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.916
Please don't be so stubborn.

00:58:41.416 --> 00:58:43.083
Darling, the signal will be lost.

00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:45.500
Please say something, my precious!

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.375
Just for you

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.375
My soul awaits

00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:58.000
O precious one
Just for me

00:58:58.416 --> 00:59:02.541
Speak at least a single word

00:59:02.958 --> 00:59:06.166
My precious

00:59:40.666 --> 00:59:45.083
All this time apart we've stayed
Sweet longing in my heart has stayed

00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:49.583
Life turned bitter
Without your love

00:59:49.875 --> 00:59:54.333
What gift will win your heart today?
How do I persuade you?

00:59:54.416 --> 00:59:59.041
Tell me the price to end this fight
I'll pay the bribe to make it right

00:59:59.125 --> 01:00:03.458
No storm stirs around me

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:07.375
Yet I'm drowning endlessly
Show me the way

01:00:07.916 --> 01:00:10.500
Why all this?
How long can you keep doing this?

01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:11.458
I've got to, sister.

01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:14.291
This is the only way to show him
the fear and pain in my love.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:16.541
I didn't smile when he left.

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:18.291
I didn't even speak
when he called from the boat.

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:19.541
Wait and see.

01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:22.791
As soon as the boat docks in 30 days,
he'll come running straight to me.

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.541
Just for you

01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:30.333
My soul awaits

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:34.875
O precious, just for me

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:39.791
Speak at least a word

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:42.958
My precious

01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:45.250
Hey! What is this?

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:46.958
Will you speak to him or not?

01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:52.791
- Continue writing. B-A-T, Bat.
- Hey, she doesn't want to speak.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Put me on speaker, Mom.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.500
Here, you're on speaker now.
Speak louder.

01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:57.833
- Here.
- Please, dear.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.333
At least talk to me now.

01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:01.458
I've been calling for so many days.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:03.208
Not a single word from you yet.

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:06.166
See, if you still don't speak to me now,

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.250
I swear I will…

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:10.083
We need to go fishing, dear.

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:13.250
Raju, are you getting on the boat?

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:14.916
The boat has started, sister.

01:01:15.416 --> 01:01:17.583
Ask her to say just one word!

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.041
Talk to him.

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:21.791
My precious!

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.583
Darling, please don't sulk like that!

01:01:24.791 --> 01:01:26.500
Hey, Sathya! Sathya!

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.958
Hey, she's leaving.

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:31.125
Just for you

01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:35.833
My soul awaits

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:40.375
My precious
Just for me

01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:45.041
Please speak a word

01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:47.291
My precious

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:03.125
I was done with Raju that very day.

01:02:03.916 --> 01:02:05.333
He couldn't stay away from the sea.

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:08.041
And I couldn't stay calm when he left.

01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.958
Love comes with fear and trust.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:14.916
But in our case,
fear consumed our entire love.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:16.958
I don't want such a love anymore.

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:23.500
After Raju left,

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:26.041
I felt like I was
gathering the remains of my life.

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:29.958
If there's one person left
in this world for me, it's my father.

01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.458
The only thing that can bring him joy

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:34.791
is my wedding.

01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:39.875
Before I marry you,

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.083
I need to say three things to Raju.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:46.125
I need to tell him I didn't betray him.

01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:50.375
I should tell Dad, who
left fishing because of me.

01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:52.583
I need to tell him that
he's no longer a part of my life.

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:55.750
These three sentences

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:58.375
and three minutes,
that's all we have left between us.

01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.208
I got it.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.291
From this moment on,

01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:06.125
I'll be waiting

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:07.708
for Raju to come back.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.333
Daddha!

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:26.458
The storm is intensifying.
Ask everyone to stay alert. Speed up!

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:30.458
Hey, Suri!

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:34.625
- Dad!
- Look after everything at that end.

01:03:34.791 --> 01:03:36.208
- Careful!
- Okay!

01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:38.041
I'll take care of it.

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:39.458
Come on, guys!

01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:43.708
The storm isn't abating!
Move everything into storage!

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:44.708
Okay, Dad!

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.083
Hey, careful!

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.333
Guys, the fish are falling!
Come on!

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:54.500
Hey! Go near the engine!

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.666
Pull faster, guys!

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.500
Hey! Be careful!

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:02.916
Hey, Kittu!

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:05.375
Careful!
Hey, Bhairi!

01:04:05.583 --> 01:04:07.208
- Hold on to Kittu.
- Okay, Daddha.

01:04:07.291 --> 01:04:08.500
Hey, stay back!

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:11.333
Grandpa!

01:04:13.125 --> 01:04:14.666
Grandpa!

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.750
Kittu!

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.458
- Grandpa!
- Kittu!

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.000
Hey!

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.958
Why aren't you careful?

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.750
- Bhairi, take Kittu into the storage area.
- Okay.

01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:41.458
Hey, hurry up! Get in!

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:47.625
All boats, listen up.
Turn South to 42 degrees!

01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:49.791
Daddha, 42 degrees towards the South!

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.458
The waves are growing stronger.
Turn quickly, turn fast!

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.666
All boats, align in a single row
and move quickly!

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:02.708
Turn quickly!

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:07.875
Daddha!

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.125
Look over there!
That small boat seems stuck in the waves.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:15.875
It looks like it's out of control!

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.291
Daddha!
Hurry up!

01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:30.583
The big ship is about to crash
into the small boat!

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:44.791
- Help!
- Help!

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:46.625
Help…

01:05:48.166 --> 01:05:51.833
Raju, that boat isn't one of ours.
Think about it.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.875
Hey, why are they going that way?

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.208
Let's move that way.

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.208
Turn fast. Turn!

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.458
Appanna! The anchor!

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:10.708
- Hey!
- Yes, Raju!

01:06:14.416 --> 01:06:15.416
Yes, alright.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.750
Help, brother!

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.875
Brother! Help!

01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.000
Hold on tight.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.458
Help! Help, brother!

01:06:53.416 --> 01:06:55.791
Brother! Help!

01:06:56.666 --> 01:06:57.875
Raju!

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:54.666
Hold on!

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.458
Pull, guys! Harder!

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.958
Lachi, pull!

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.791
- Pull! Faster!
- Come on!

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:05.125
- Pull, guys! Come on!
- Pull!

01:08:07.958 --> 01:08:08.875
Faster!

01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:10.750
Pull, guys!

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:32.833
{\an8}Gowramma!

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:39.000
You got a letter from the RDO office.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.541
Take a look at this.

01:09:13.708 --> 01:09:15.041
{\an8}JAI DURGA BHAVANI

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:16.250
{\an8}"Jai Durga Bhavani."

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.666
{\an8}- "Mother, two months ago…"
- Mother, two months ago

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:21.916
{\an8}at the Veeravalli port,

01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:25.958
{\an8}twenty-two people were on a boat fishing.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:30.333
{\an8}All of us were caught
up in a dangerous storm.

01:09:46.083 --> 01:09:47.000
He's awake.

01:09:51.708 --> 01:09:52.666
Where are you from?

01:09:54.666 --> 01:09:55.708
What's your name?

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.041
Where do you belong, brother?

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:02.458
Where are you from?

01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:19.916
- What's a Pakistan ship doing here?
- Why did they come towards us?

01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:26.041
Be warned!

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.708
{\an8}You've entered Pakistani waters illegally.

01:10:31.833 --> 01:10:33.000
{\an8}You're under arrest.

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.916
After capturing us at sea,

01:10:47.458 --> 01:10:48.708
{\an8}they took us to their court.

01:10:49.166 --> 01:10:51.416
Until they determine whether
we're fishermen, terrorists,

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:54.125
or if we came with another agenda,

01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:57.375
they've ordered us to be jailed.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:05.041
While saving someone in the storm,
he crossed the border unknowingly.

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:08.333
The Pakistani Navy police arrested them.

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:42.666
Everyone, take off your clothes.

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.916
- Strip down completely.
- Take off your clothes!

01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:49.291
Don't do it, sir.

01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:52.000
- My son and grandson are also here.
- Hey! Strip!

01:11:54.958 --> 01:11:56.208
Hey! Get lost!

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:49.291
- What is it, dear?
- Raju…

01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:52.041
if you take longer this time,

01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:53.583
we'll get married,

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:56.208
and by the time you return,
I'll hand you two kids.

01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:58.125
- What do you say?
- Two kids?

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.875
Of course.
A girl in my mother's memory,

01:13:00.958 --> 01:13:02.291
and a boy in your dad's memory.

01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:05.291
- One in my uncle's memory as well…
- Sure!

01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:08.291
One in your uncle's memory,
another in my grandma's memory,

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:11.333
If we keep having kids,
I'll just run away someday.

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.375
Run away?

01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:15.291
Where will you go?

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.291
Do you think
I'd let go of you so easily?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.875
Even if you're across the seven seas,

01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:22.625
I'll pick you up and drop you right here!

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:26.666
Where will you drop me?
You can't even swim properly.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:29.416
What if I can't swim?
I've got loads of love for you.

01:13:34.416 --> 01:13:35.291
Hey!

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.875
Get up!

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:38.500
Get up!

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:41.458
Move it! Everyone!

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.541
What's happening, bro?

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.041
Whoever comes to our country from India,

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:02.500
- Rakim welcomes them in this manner.
- Rakim bhai!

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:17.791
Hey, write "Hindustan" on that wall.

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:18.791
Hey!

01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:20.083
Everyone, give him a salute!

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:23.416
What are you guys looking at? Salute!

01:14:32.041 --> 01:14:33.708
Your national song,

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:35.666
"Vande Mataram…"

01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:39.291
- Can anyone sing it?
- I can, sir!

01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:40.291
Kittu!

01:14:41.416 --> 01:14:42.833
Mashallah!

01:14:43.291 --> 01:14:44.166
Come on.

01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:45.291
Come on.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.250
Awesome.

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:52.541
- You can sing, right?
- Yes.

01:14:53.708 --> 01:14:54.583
Come on.

01:14:56.583 --> 01:14:57.500
Sing.

01:14:58.041 --> 01:14:59.250
Sing loudly!

01:14:59.916 --> 01:15:03.000
If you sing here, it should be
heard in your country, India!

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:05.750
Salute!

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:09.541
Sing now, son.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.666
- Sing.
- I will.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:20.375
Vande Mataram!

01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:25.000
Vande Mataram!

01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:31.333
Rich with water, rich in fruits…

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:21.916
Very nice.

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:45.041
Hey, you! Aren't you feeling bad?

01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:48.666
Or have you gotten used to ignoring
whatever we do to your country?

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:51.958
That's no big deal.

01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:56.333
Even a street dog feels the urge
to urinate when it sees a wall.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.416
Well said!

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.708
Then write "Pakistan" on that wall.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:08.875
If any Indian present here has the guts,

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.166
let them urinate on it.

01:17:15.958 --> 01:17:19.833
If all the street dogs in our country
head towards yours,

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.708
your country would disappear
from the world map.

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:25.166
There you go!

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:37.208
Hey! What are you doing?

01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:42.166
{\an8}Started with the fights already?

01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:44.208
Who's starting a fight, sir?

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.416
Can't you see who's waiting to kill whom?

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.375
Hey!

01:17:48.958 --> 01:17:51.666
Even I feel like killing you guys.

01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:53.791
He's a terrorist.

01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:56.041
Won't he feel like it?

01:17:58.583 --> 01:17:59.541
Hey, move it.

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:00.625
Everybody, move!

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:05.750
Wait up, Rakim.

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.625
{\an8}This is your last warning.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.208
{\an8}Those 22 men out there

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.291
{\an8}are in remand and the court records.

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:15.750
Remember that.

01:18:15.833 --> 01:18:18.458
Remember where you are
and what's at stake.

01:18:18.541 --> 01:18:20.291
Don't get worked up for no reason.

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:25.083
Would you value your pride
or your life? Idiot!

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.000
Go.

01:18:30.916 --> 01:18:31.750
Hey!

01:18:34.583 --> 01:18:35.625
Are you the Thandel?

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:38.166
What does Thandel mean?

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:41.125
Owner?

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:42.041
No, sir.

01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:44.458
Leader!

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.750
SATHYA RAJU

01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:00.125
{\an8}It's been months
since I heard your voice.

01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:03.916
{\an8}I don't remember the last time
I saw your photo on my phone.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.041
{\an8}I'm unable to control myself, darling.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:21.875
How are you, Uncle?

01:20:22.666 --> 01:20:23.500
Boy!

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:25.125
Dear! Son-in-law is here.

01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:27.500
Please come in.
Bring some water, dear.

01:20:27.583 --> 01:20:28.666
That's alright, Uncle.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.000
How are the preparations
coming along, Uncle?

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:35.083
We completed the rice ceremony
for Lord Ganesha this morning.

01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:37.583
We'll be taking up work one by one.

01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:40.791
- Dad, here.
- Well…

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:44.750
can the wedding still be postponed
after the rice ceremony?

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:47.625
Why do you say that?

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:49.125
Is there a problem?

01:20:51.125 --> 01:20:54.541
The thing is if you
buy gold in installments,

01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:57.958
you must clear
all the payments to fully own it.

01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:04.208
Similarly, even Sathya
has some unfinished installments.

01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:06.250
Those three words with Raju.

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.791
Uncle, listen.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.916
What's more important
than me marrying Sathya

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.208
is that Sathya marries me with happiness.

01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:20.583
{\an8}Ladies! If your men are stuck
in Pakistan, come and gather here!

01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:21.500
Sathya.

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:23.708
Come here.

01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:26.416
{\an8}- This way, lady. Please stand here.
- Let's get our photo clicked.

01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:28.750
Come!

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:13.083
Raju, everyone has received
a letter from home.

01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:16.375
Your mom wrote you a letter,
but why didn't Sathya write one?

01:22:52.166 --> 01:22:53.875
{\an8}Who told you she didn't write to me?

01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:00.208
{\an8}My darling poured her heart out
with just one teardrop.

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:21.875
Your love is too vast for words

01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:27.666
That's what you made me realize

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:33.166
In the darkness that surrounds me

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:39.125
Your tear-stained letter
Is my only light

01:23:39.208 --> 01:23:41.833
My guiding light

01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:16.875
Hey! Only you two are coming.
Where's Kittu?

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:19.291
He came 30 minutes ago
saying he was hungry.

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:21.708
What 30 minutes ago? He was
with you and should come with you.

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:23.083
He said he'd come here.

01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:24.666
Can't you dimwits
take care of a child?

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:26.458
If he left 30 minutes ago,
why isn't he here yet?

01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:27.416
Hey, Suri!

01:24:28.291 --> 01:24:29.791
Kittu! Kittu!

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:32.041
- Go and search near the bathroom.
- Okay, bro.

01:24:32.125 --> 01:24:33.000
- Let's go.
- Take this.

01:24:35.416 --> 01:24:36.291
Kittu!

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:40.583
Kittu.

01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:50.041
Kittu!

01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:55.083
Hey, Kittu! Dear!

01:24:55.583 --> 01:24:57.000
Get up!

01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:58.958
- What happened?
- Kittu!

01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.125
- Get up!
- Kittu!

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:02.000
- What happened?
- Hey!

01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:03.916
Kittu!

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.333
- Kittu.
- Tell us what happened.

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:08.958
Say something.

01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:10.083
- Kittu.
- Get up…

01:25:10.166 --> 01:25:12.541
Suri, take him to the doctor fast.

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:14.458
- Get going!
- Kittu!

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:25.750
Hold him tight!

01:25:56.625 --> 01:25:58.166
I did it, guys.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.250
Cleansing.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.833
Raju!

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.083
Daddha… he's calling us.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.166
Even stray dogs pee, don't they?

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:17.166
There should be a difference
between us and the dogs, right?

01:26:20.333 --> 01:26:23.500
That's why it's not a mistake.

01:26:27.166 --> 01:26:28.041
Oh my!

01:26:29.791 --> 01:26:33.875
Snapping a manja
isn't as easy as talking big.

01:26:55.125 --> 01:26:57.833
{\an8}I've already sent your plea
to the central government.

01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:59.708
{\an8}I'll do everything I can.

01:26:59.791 --> 01:27:01.500
{\an8}I also sent the file
to the collector's office.

01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:04.125
We, too, would be happy
to see your men return home.

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.666
It's all in the hands
of Ms. Sushila Swaraj in Delhi.

01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:09.208
Everything will be alright.
Just be brave.

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:14.166
Though he offered no help,

01:27:14.375 --> 01:27:16.083
the minister's verbal assurances
gave us hope and courage.

01:27:16.166 --> 01:27:17.833
It is difficult to survive
without money.

01:27:17.916 --> 01:27:18.750
Eat up, dear.

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:22.000
Look. The child is unable
to eat tasteless food.

01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.500
All those days
our men were working hard at sea,

01:27:27.833 --> 01:27:29.291
we thought they were away from us.

01:27:30.833 --> 01:27:34.708
With them no longer at sea,
our lives changed within six months.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.083
Lend me money this one time.

01:27:36.166 --> 01:27:38.250
I'll return it when my husband returns.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.375
You'll get it. But you don't have to
return the favor with money.

01:27:42.458 --> 01:27:44.916
I'll accept anything you give.
Think about it once.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.833
Give it! Get lost!

01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:49.541
- I beg you. I'll pay you in four days.
- How long do I wait?

01:27:49.875 --> 01:27:50.791
Have you lost it?

01:27:51.083 --> 01:27:53.500
Won't you even spare
a pregnant woman for money?

01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:57.125
I can't go hungry just because
this woman is pregnant.

01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:00.583
How much does she owe you?
Tell me, I'll pay.

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.833
Really? You can pay for this month.

01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.916
What about next month?
And the one after that?

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:07.333
And the one after that?

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:09.833
What are you thinking?

01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.750
Look at her, always ready to ask!

01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.166
In another six months,

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:17.375
even our dead bodies
won't be found in the village.

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:21.833
Get lost!

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:23.958
He won't even leave a rupee.

01:28:28.875 --> 01:28:30.000
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:31.875
- Sathya?
- Can you help me with something?

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.583
- What is it?
- I need to go to Gujarat.

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:39.208
Why Gujarat?

01:28:41.666 --> 01:28:44.666
As usual, the boss withheld
seven months of wages.

01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:47.875
I don't understand what he gains
by holding onto our hard-earned money.

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.125
Come in.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.250
- Who are you, girl?
- I'm from Matchilesam.

01:29:01.333 --> 01:29:02.166
Why are you here?

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:06.791
I'm here to collect the seven months'
pending salary for our men.

01:29:07.166 --> 01:29:08.083
Have you got any shame?

01:29:09.166 --> 01:29:11.041
What makes you think
you can demand this?

01:29:11.208 --> 01:29:13.083
I'm not asking you for a loan.

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:15.125
- It's the pay for our men's hard work.
- Hey!

01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:16.708
Lower your voice!

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.208
Yes, I did hold back some of their money.

01:29:21.166 --> 01:29:22.666
But I won't give it to you.
What will you do about it?

01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:27.250
Your anger and your sob story

01:29:27.333 --> 01:29:29.916
won't get anything out of me.

01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:31.208
Get lost!

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:33.666
Your face irritates me!

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:38.250
Sathya, when it comes to paying money,
this is how these people behave.

01:29:38.375 --> 01:29:39.625
Don't take it to heart.

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:43.333
Even your men couldn't get him
to pay up the dues.

01:29:43.416 --> 01:29:44.791
How can we do it?

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:46.083
Come on. Let's go home.

01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:06.916
Oh my! What's this?

01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:08.708
{\an8}Are you protesting?

01:30:10.041 --> 01:30:10.916
{\an8}This is my area.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.166
Freedom! Freedom!

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.416
Freedom! Freedom!

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.875
- Freedom!
- Hey, who's that girl?

01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:22.166
She's related to Raju,
who's been arrested in Pakistan.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.500
She's here for the pending salaries.

01:30:25.625 --> 01:30:27.500
Yeah, right!
As if that man is going to pay!

01:30:33.416 --> 01:30:35.250
Listen, girl. Nothing will happen.

01:30:35.333 --> 01:30:38.125
No one will help you
no matter how long you protest.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.041
I don't mind, brother.

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:46.458
Only when our fishing nets
drop into the sea

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:48.666
will the coffers
of these businessmen fill.

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:53.708
And do you know
what he said when I asked

01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:57.083
for our money
to save our kids from starvation?

01:31:00.083 --> 01:31:03.875
{\an8}Hardworking people
like us need your support.

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:07.833
- Breaking the shackles…
- Hey!

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:09.541
- Freedom!
- All of you!

01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:11.916
Stop the boat and come here.

01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:14.208
- Hey, come on.
- Hey, he's calling us.

01:31:14.416 --> 01:31:17.583
Freedom! Freedom!

01:31:17.666 --> 01:31:23.833
In a war without an army
Courage is the only weapon, march on!

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:30.458
Who dares to stop me
If I question these limits?

01:31:30.541 --> 01:31:33.958
Freedom! Freedom!

01:31:34.041 --> 01:31:37.000
Freedom! Freedom!

01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:38.333
Freedom!

01:31:38.416 --> 01:31:40.083
{\an8}All our boats have stopped
because of you.

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:43.750
{\an8}Settle her dues
and send her away quickly.

01:31:46.416 --> 01:31:48.125
Here's everything I owe you.

01:31:53.166 --> 01:31:54.541
A Telugu girl came to Gujarat

01:31:54.625 --> 01:31:57.708
and fought a long battle against
the bosses to recover her due payments.

01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:06.500
While we're spending
our days in tears,

01:32:06.666 --> 01:32:08.625
how could you be so brave, Sathya?

01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:10.666
Why should we leave our men's
hard-earned money with someone else

01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.458
suffer from hunger?

01:32:13.291 --> 01:32:15.916
My kid got his tonsils
removed, guys.

01:32:16.458 --> 01:32:18.333
{\an8}My oldie got a new pair of glasses.

01:32:18.416 --> 01:32:20.583
{\an8}I was worried all these days whether
she'd sign those property papers.

01:32:20.666 --> 01:32:22.541
{\an8}Nothing to fear now.
I own all the property.

01:32:22.791 --> 01:32:24.833
We thought we'd dry up
by the time they returned.

01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:27.916
But we can eat today,
thanks to you.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.166
Bless you.

01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:30.416
Calm down, Aunty.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.875
My heart is beating happily, Raju.

01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:38.291
I thought my baby would die
because of hunger.

01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:40.791
Sathya, if my kid lives,
it's only because of you.

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:42.708
If it's a boy, I'll name him Raju.

01:32:42.916 --> 01:32:45.250
And if it's a girl, I'll give her
your name, Sathya.

01:32:45.333 --> 01:32:48.041
- Freedom! Freedom!
- Freedom!

01:32:49.833 --> 01:32:51.791
Rajulamma is protecting us
through Sathya.

01:32:52.083 --> 01:32:55.166
Hey, Raju. If you're Thandel Raja,
Sathya is Thandel Rani.

01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:04.458
{\an8}They're from my village, ma'am.
We raised a plea.

01:33:04.958 --> 01:33:06.083
{\an8}It's still under process.

01:33:06.583 --> 01:33:08.166
{\an8}Your involvement
would speed things up, ma'am.

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:12.916
{\an8}Getting them released would increase
our party's vote bank in my area.

01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:17.625
{\an8}We should work for the well-being
of our people, not just for votes.

01:33:17.791 --> 01:33:21.666
Nation first, party next, self last.
This is what I believe.

01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:25.166
If those men are innocent,
start efforts to get them released.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.125
Thank you, ma'am.

01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:38.041
- Hello?
- I'm calling from the office

01:33:38.125 --> 01:33:39.583
of the External Affairs Minister,
Sushila Swaraj.

01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:44.750
The 22 men stuck in that country
have received their release orders.

01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:47.625
Your men will be released
on August 15th. Okay?

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.166
Thank you! Thank you, sir!

01:33:54.541 --> 01:33:57.333
- Aunty! Gouramma Aunty!
- What is it?

01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:59.625
Our people are coming
home on August 15th!

01:33:59.708 --> 01:34:01.875
- Raju too!
- Is Raju returning?

01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:06.708
So, shall we fix the wedding date?

01:34:08.333 --> 01:34:10.875
The time has come for you
to say those three words to Raju.

01:34:12.666 --> 01:34:14.666
The Karachi court issued an order

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:17.708
{\an8}to release 22 Indians who
were captured on Pakistani soil.

01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:56.250
Freedom! Freedom!

01:34:56.333 --> 01:34:59.458
Freedom! Freedom!

01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:02.666
Freedom! Freedom!

01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:06.125
Freedom! Freedom!

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:12.208
Freedom!

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.416
Freedom!

01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:18.750
Freedom!

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.416
Why are you laughing, sister?

01:35:21.541 --> 01:35:25.583
You're doing precisely what
Raju would do in this situation.

01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:26.666
What's the matter?

01:35:27.416 --> 01:35:30.125
Just because I got the money,
how's this acting like Raju?

01:35:31.583 --> 01:35:33.166
I'm doing all this so that
our children can go to school

01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:35.083
and we can have enough to eat.

01:35:35.333 --> 01:35:36.708
Sister, whether you
believe it or not,

01:35:36.791 --> 01:35:40.333
my love for him died when he left me
without even caring for me.

01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:44.625
If your love for him is dead,
why won't you eat the meat?

01:35:44.708 --> 01:35:46.500
What's the connection
between the two?

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:49.916
I don't like him anymore.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.208
You don't like him, right?

01:35:51.416 --> 01:35:52.250
Then, eat this.

01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:55.041
Eat it! Just eat it!

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.458
If your love for him is dead,

01:35:57.541 --> 01:35:59.458
what's the problem
with eating this fish curry?

01:35:59.916 --> 01:36:00.916
Eat it.

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:20.750
Sathya!

01:36:44.791 --> 01:36:49.000
His good luck started when
your girl agreed to marry him.

01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:52.458
These are good times
in his life now.

01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:53.916
He's unstoppable.

01:36:54.583 --> 01:36:58.416
The priest said September 2nd
is a very auspicious day.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.458
Shall we fix the wedding
on that day?

01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:02.458
What do you say?

01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:03.791
What do you say, dear?

01:37:05.125 --> 01:37:06.041
Alright then,
brother-in-law.

01:37:06.125 --> 01:37:07.916
SATHYA WEDS MURALI

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.375
KORACHA'S WEDDING INVITATION
02-09-2019 WEDNESDAY

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:13.125
KORACHA'S WEDDING INVITATION
SATHYA WEDS MURALI

01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:15.875
It's Sathya's wedding card, Daddha.
Why shouldn't we tell him?

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:20.708
If he finds out, his heart
won't just stop. It'll explode!

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:22.958
What shall we do?

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.458
Hey, when is the wedding?

01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:26.666
September 2nd.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.416
We'll be released on August 15th.

01:37:29.666 --> 01:37:33.250
When Raju is beside her,
who'd dare marry Sathya?

01:37:34.375 --> 01:37:37.125
He can't know a thing about
this until then. Be careful.

01:37:38.208 --> 01:37:40.291
{\an8}Given good bilateral relations,

01:37:40.375 --> 01:37:42.958
{\an8}these 22 Indian fishermen

01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:45.875
{\an8}are being released on court order

01:37:46.041 --> 01:37:48.208
on August 15th, 2019.

01:37:49.958 --> 01:37:51.000
We are leaving, Daddha.

01:37:51.791 --> 01:37:53.083
We'll be home soon.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.916
{\an8}- Please take care of them. Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:22.416 --> 01:38:24.791
- Sir? What's going on?
- Keep moving. Move fast.

01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:28.166
- What's happening, sir?
- Move outside. Come on!

01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:29.916
- Sir?
- Take them away.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.083
- What happened?
- Move, everyone!

01:38:32.166 --> 01:38:33.583
- Sir, what happened?
- Get down!

01:38:34.333 --> 01:38:37.041
- Sir! Sir!
- Sir!

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:38.958
- Sir…
- Sir, what happened?

01:38:39.333 --> 01:38:40.291
Sir?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.250
Kashmir has always been
a part of India, and it will remain so.

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.458
What are you saying?

01:38:50.625 --> 01:38:53.916
Article 370, which allows special
status to Jammu and Kashmir,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.583
has been abrogated by
the Government of India,

01:38:55.666 --> 01:38:58.375
creating a lot of havoc
in the neighboring country.

01:38:58.458 --> 01:39:02.083
The country requests that
the government's decision regarding

01:39:02.166 --> 01:39:06.583
an independent Jammu Kashmir be
reversed or it'll lead to consequences.

01:39:08.916 --> 01:39:11.083
{\an8}India has abolished Article 370.

01:39:11.166 --> 01:39:13.625
{\an8}It's chaos outside.

01:39:19.666 --> 01:39:22.000
Article 370?
What is that?

01:39:22.083 --> 01:39:25.708
Kashmir is our heart.
You Indians have stolen it from us.

01:39:26.208 --> 01:39:27.708
Kashmir was always ours. Right, sir?

01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:31.250
{\an8}Kashmir is our heart!
They have stolen it from us!

01:39:31.833 --> 01:39:33.750
We'll not spare these Indians!

01:39:34.541 --> 01:39:38.375
If they know Indians
are with you… mashallah!

01:39:38.458 --> 01:39:40.958
{\an8}There's a huge crowd. Our battalion…

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:42.875
{\an8}- We won't leave you, Indians!
- Hey!

01:39:43.083 --> 01:39:45.833
{\an8}We can't control the mob even if
the entire nation's army is deployed.

01:40:01.583 --> 01:40:03.041
Out. Everyone out.

01:40:03.958 --> 01:40:05.333
Brother, they're our prisoners.

01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:08.166
In times like this,
everyone is the same. Come.

01:40:19.833 --> 01:40:21.416
What… what are you hiding?

01:40:26.916 --> 01:40:30.250
You… Indians?
Are you all Indians?

01:40:30.333 --> 01:40:31.208
Hey!

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.625
All of them are Indians!

01:40:33.083 --> 01:40:35.291
Kill them all.
All of you, come in.

01:40:36.083 --> 01:40:37.083
Hey, come along.

01:40:42.666 --> 01:40:43.625
It's an emergency, sir.

01:40:44.333 --> 01:40:48.458
Amidst the ruckus outside,
22 fishermen are stranded.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.166
Daddha, be careful.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.916
Hey, you guys come along.

01:41:34.291 --> 01:41:35.166
You guys leave.

01:41:46.791 --> 01:41:48.125
How far did you get?

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.750
We tried our best, sir.
It's a huge crowd. We're sorry.

01:41:51.833 --> 01:41:52.833
It was beyond our control.

01:41:52.916 --> 01:41:55.791
{\an8}Raju and all his men
are running away from us.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.916
{\an8}But they won't stay alive
in this country.

01:42:01.125 --> 01:42:02.250
What are you talking about?

01:42:05.166 --> 01:42:07.250
Kashmir is ours!

01:42:07.791 --> 01:42:09.083
Pakistan…

01:42:11.583 --> 01:42:13.541
Sir, Raju and his friends
are either already dead,

01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:17.791
or if they're strong enough, they
might have escaped to their country.

01:42:18.166 --> 01:42:22.208
The higher authorities will take
action against us and suspend us.

01:42:22.291 --> 01:42:23.375
Sir!

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:07.125
{\an8}We thought you guys would run away.

01:43:08.583 --> 01:43:11.541
We have done nothing wrong
to run away, sir.

01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:14.791
We got lost and ended up here.

01:43:23.916 --> 01:43:25.916
- Hello?
- Hello, I'm calling from Matchilesam.

01:43:26.375 --> 01:43:28.833
Srikakulam… Veeravali Port. I…

01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:30.416
Yes, Ms. Sathya. Tell me.

01:43:30.875 --> 01:43:33.458
We heard they're delaying the release of
our people due to the situation outside.

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.208
Please let me speak to the minister once.

01:43:36.291 --> 01:43:38.041
Ma'am isn't here to speak to you.

01:43:39.333 --> 01:43:40.375
She's no more.

01:44:00.541 --> 01:44:01.541
- Hello?
- Sir.

01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:04.166
Can you do something to help with
our people's canceled release orders?

01:44:04.375 --> 01:44:07.166
To reissue the release orders
passed by Sushila Swaraj,

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:10.125
you should go to Delhi and try to meet
her daughter, Bansuri Swaraj.

01:44:10.666 --> 01:44:12.833
If there's anyone who can
help you in this matter, it's her.

01:44:12.916 --> 01:44:14.541
Please go to Delhi.

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:16.041
Thank you, sir.

01:44:24.875 --> 01:44:26.125
You have nothing to worry about.

01:44:26.333 --> 01:44:27.875
When we return from Delhi,

01:44:27.958 --> 01:44:29.458
we'll return with our village folks.

01:44:32.916 --> 01:44:36.083
If you don't mind,
can I call you "my precious"?

01:44:39.125 --> 01:44:41.041
I know you don't like it

01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:43.458
when anyone other than Raju
calls you that.

01:44:44.166 --> 01:44:46.708
But once we get married,
I won't be a stranger to you. Right?

01:44:59.750 --> 01:45:00.625
{\an8}Ma'am!

01:45:03.041 --> 01:45:03.916
{\an8}Ma'am…

01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:08.625
Ma'am…

01:45:11.958 --> 01:45:14.291
Why do you want to stay in an inn?

01:45:14.833 --> 01:45:16.541
I said I'd book rooms in a hotel.

01:45:17.291 --> 01:45:18.916
I'll stay outside if you wish.

01:45:19.416 --> 01:45:20.916
At least you tell her.

01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:23.791
It's alright.
It's better if we stay here now.

01:45:26.375 --> 01:45:30.458
She's got some issues
to settle with Shiva.

01:45:31.125 --> 01:45:31.958
That's why.

01:45:42.125 --> 01:45:43.000
Daddha.

01:45:50.125 --> 01:45:52.000
Our women in the village
will be disappointed to hear

01:45:52.416 --> 01:45:54.208
that our release orders got canceled.

01:45:55.833 --> 01:45:57.125
I wrote in the letter that

01:45:57.208 --> 01:45:59.541
the release would happen in a week or
ten days, so they should remain patient.

01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:02.250
Just mail it and come back.

01:46:07.416 --> 01:46:08.291
Daddha.

01:46:15.625 --> 01:46:21.708
We wanted to take Kashmir from you
and make your country headless.

01:46:23.125 --> 01:46:24.041
Nonetheless…

01:46:24.541 --> 01:46:26.166
congratulations to you all!

01:46:27.458 --> 01:46:28.625
Congratulations!

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:32.416
Let's celebrate your
Independence Day.

01:46:33.416 --> 01:46:36.083
On this special day,

01:46:37.416 --> 01:46:40.250
we'll give a gift you'll never forget.

01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:41.708
Just for you…

01:46:52.208 --> 01:46:55.291
And as per tradition, you will be
singing the national anthem,

01:46:55.958 --> 01:46:57.541
"Vande Mataram."

01:46:59.166 --> 01:47:00.500
You will sing, right?

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:03.708
If you don't sing properly,

01:47:04.125 --> 01:47:07.125
you will get the same treatment

01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:09.125
as this little guy.

01:47:09.833 --> 01:47:10.958
Got it?

01:47:12.958 --> 01:47:13.875
Move!

01:47:34.333 --> 01:47:35.291
Rakim bhai!

01:48:42.375 --> 01:48:44.791
Tear that flag into pieces!

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.708
Close block A.

01:49:10.458 --> 01:49:11.625
Close block B.

01:49:12.083 --> 01:49:12.916
{\an8}Hey, block C.

01:49:13.166 --> 01:49:14.375
{\an8}Close all the blocks.

01:49:15.375 --> 01:49:16.291
Sir.

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:19.041
- Yes?
- Someone's hoisting the Indian flag, sir.

01:49:19.125 --> 01:49:20.083
What do you mean
by the Indian flag?

01:49:37.041 --> 01:49:39.208
Alert all the security personnel.
I'm on my way.

01:49:39.875 --> 01:49:41.666
Control them till I get there. Okay?

01:49:50.458 --> 01:49:51.583
Hey, move!

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.375
Move back!

01:51:17.333 --> 01:51:19.083
{\an8}Sir, the situation is out of my control.

01:51:19.208 --> 01:51:22.166
Listen. Close down all the gates
connecting block C.

01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:23.125
Okay, sir.

01:51:25.625 --> 01:51:27.375
Sir, this is a little urgent.

01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:29.500
- We've got to get back fast.
- Yes, alright.

01:51:29.583 --> 01:51:30.583
- Yes?
- It's a mayhem here.

01:51:30.666 --> 01:51:32.166
Indian prisoners are creating trouble.

01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:34.416
The situation is out of control.
Hurry to block C now!

01:51:34.583 --> 01:51:35.416
What happened, sir?

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:36.583
- Everyone, come on!
- Come on!

01:51:36.666 --> 01:51:39.666
Freedom! Freedom!

01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:43.041
Freedom! Freedom!

01:52:19.458 --> 01:52:22.458
Raju, be it a man or a flag,

01:52:22.875 --> 01:52:28.083
the final honor is to merge
with water, earth, or fire.

01:52:30.833 --> 01:52:31.750
Freedom!

01:52:34.125 --> 01:52:35.041
Freedom!

01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:38.250
Freedom!

01:52:40.583 --> 01:52:41.500
Freedom!

01:52:56.875 --> 01:53:00.666
When our entire nation is in chaos,

01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:03.166
is this where you choose
to show your patriotism?

01:53:03.375 --> 01:53:04.208
Idiot!

01:53:05.083 --> 01:53:05.916
Jai Hind!

01:53:25.583 --> 01:53:27.333
Hey, beat up this rascal.

01:53:33.541 --> 01:53:35.083
Lock him up in the dark cell.

01:54:22.041 --> 01:54:23.750
Ma'am? Ma'am?

01:54:51.666 --> 01:54:52.500
Sathya.

01:54:53.208 --> 01:54:56.958
We were able to come this far
with the help of that PA and others,

01:54:57.208 --> 01:54:58.833
but do you think she'd meet us?

01:55:00.541 --> 01:55:02.708
I'm clueless about
what's going to happen

01:55:02.833 --> 01:55:05.708
and what we need to do.

01:55:21.583 --> 01:55:24.708
- Hello?
- Is this Sathya from Srikakulam?

01:55:24.791 --> 01:55:25.750
Yes. Who's this?

01:55:25.833 --> 01:55:28.208
I'm calling from
the Karachi Central Jail, Pakistan.

01:55:28.291 --> 01:55:30.250
- Karachi?
- Be on the line for a minute.

01:55:33.291 --> 01:55:34.833
Raju. Here, talk to her.

01:55:38.166 --> 01:55:39.916
It's your Sathya. Talk to her.

01:56:04.583 --> 01:56:05.458
Not like this, brother.

01:56:08.125 --> 01:56:09.583
The day I get released…

01:56:11.708 --> 01:56:15.416
The moment I step off the train,
I'll grab her hand and run.

01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:19.791
We won't catch our breath until we reach
the lighthouse and raise the flag.

01:56:19.875 --> 01:56:22.041
I'll pull her close,
hold her tight, and kiss her.

01:56:25.375 --> 01:56:27.500
I'll cup her face in my trembling hands…

01:56:30.333 --> 01:56:32.458
and whisper through my tears,
"My precious!"

01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:35.666
You have to see her then.

01:56:38.416 --> 01:56:39.458
Tears glistening in her eyes…

01:56:40.833 --> 01:56:42.833
her cheeks flushed red with emotion.

01:56:47.791 --> 01:56:49.291
It is for that moment, that sight…

01:56:49.833 --> 01:56:51.416
that I've endured everything
and kept going.

01:56:53.291 --> 01:56:54.791
I still have hope in life.

01:56:55.458 --> 01:56:56.916
What's this, man? You are crazy!

01:56:59.458 --> 01:57:01.208
He's not willing to speak to you.

01:57:08.416 --> 01:57:09.333
What happened?

01:57:15.166 --> 01:57:16.125
Sathya!

01:57:47.041 --> 01:57:48.416
How did you get wet?

01:57:49.208 --> 01:57:50.083
Why don't you dry yourself off?

01:57:51.458 --> 01:57:54.625
I'm famished. Shall we eat?
It's already late.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:58.833
It's Mom.

01:58:00.125 --> 01:58:01.583
- Yes, Mom.
- Kannaiah.

01:58:01.791 --> 01:58:02.875
Have you guys started?

01:58:03.333 --> 01:58:05.083
What are you still doing over there?

01:58:05.291 --> 01:58:07.375
You've got a lot of things
to do back here.

01:58:07.458 --> 01:58:08.500
That's alright, Mom.

01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:12.125
I'll handle it after I return.
We're not done here yet.

01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:13.708
We'll start as soon as we're done.

01:58:13.958 --> 01:58:14.791
Give me that.

01:58:15.083 --> 01:58:18.000
How can you not start
with your wedding in three days?

01:58:18.083 --> 01:58:20.333
Let me speak to the daughter-in-law once.

01:58:20.416 --> 01:58:23.750
No, Dad. I said we'll start
when we're done, right?

01:58:23.833 --> 01:58:25.125
- Listen to me--
- Hang up now.

01:58:28.208 --> 01:58:29.666
They're worried about the pending tasks.

01:58:30.541 --> 01:58:33.416
Sathya, the wedding
is in just three days.

01:58:33.625 --> 01:58:35.333
But we're still here.

01:58:36.166 --> 01:58:37.958
She's not even noticing us.

01:58:38.708 --> 01:58:40.583
His parents are worried back there.

01:58:41.041 --> 01:58:43.375
Your dad will feel dishonored
if we're late.

01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:47.666
What do we do?
Think about it.

01:58:51.916 --> 01:58:55.125
The wedding is in three days, right?
Dress me as a bride tomorrow.

01:59:09.541 --> 01:59:12.416
{\an8}- Who's that girl?
- This is a publicity stunt, ma'am.

01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:14.500
- You can ignore it.
- Find out the truth before you speak.

01:59:14.583 --> 01:59:17.166
{\an8}Unless a girl is desperate,
she wouldn't be here in this pouring rain…

01:59:19.625 --> 01:59:21.750
dressed as a bride.
Open the gate.

01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:46.666
I understood the entire thing.
Go back to your village. Get married.

01:59:47.916 --> 01:59:51.458
You believed in me and came so far.

01:59:51.833 --> 01:59:54.625
I'll try my best. Alright?

01:59:55.125 --> 01:59:56.041
Go.

01:59:56.166 --> 01:59:58.583
Ma'am, my wedding is in three days.

01:59:59.375 --> 02:00:02.166
I promised the villagers I'd get
married once everyone came back.

02:00:04.166 --> 02:00:06.916
It's not as easy as you think.

02:00:07.416 --> 02:00:09.708
Your people are in Pakistan.

02:00:09.958 --> 02:00:13.041
There are regulations and protocols
to get them released.

02:00:13.333 --> 02:00:15.875
A lot has changed
between the two nations

02:00:15.958 --> 02:00:18.500
after the Article 370 issue.
You know that, right?

02:00:19.833 --> 02:00:21.250
Go back to your village.

02:00:22.125 --> 02:00:23.916
I'll take care of everything. Okay?

02:00:27.833 --> 02:00:29.458
The nation has boundaries…

02:00:30.833 --> 02:00:32.708
but our misfortune knows no barriers.

02:00:42.083 --> 02:00:46.708
Without us asking, you understood
the pain faced by our men

02:00:47.166 --> 02:00:49.458
and passed the release orders.

02:00:50.666 --> 02:00:52.833
That was your mother's last signature.

02:01:00.625 --> 02:01:01.625
With your mother,

02:01:01.833 --> 02:01:03.500
our hopes too have faded away, ma'am.

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:10.333
Wait…

02:01:12.833 --> 02:01:14.416
When did you say your wedding is?

02:01:15.208 --> 02:01:16.625
September 2nd, ma'am.

02:01:17.333 --> 02:01:18.416
I assure you, dear.

02:01:19.083 --> 02:01:22.291
I'll speak to the concerned
minister and try my best.

02:01:22.916 --> 02:01:24.166
Thank you, ma'am.

02:01:31.791 --> 02:01:34.416
Won't my face glow
with a tilak, Sathya?

02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:36.500
All this happiness is because of you.

02:01:36.583 --> 02:01:40.916
Worried about your brother-in-law,
I was scared about Chinni.

02:01:41.166 --> 02:01:42.500
I'm not worried anymore.

02:01:42.833 --> 02:01:44.500
The entire village
is celebrating, you know?

02:01:46.416 --> 02:01:47.625
Why are you crying?

02:01:48.666 --> 02:01:49.625
I'm scared.

02:01:51.125 --> 02:01:55.416
His heart will burst the moment
he steps out and finds out the truth.

02:01:57.250 --> 02:02:00.666
These years of torment he endured
in Pakistan pales in comparison

02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:03.916
to the punishment I inflicted on him
by agreeing to this wedding.

02:02:05.375 --> 02:02:07.208
What have I done?

02:02:10.666 --> 02:02:13.875
Hearing him speak about me
on the phone the other day,

02:02:14.125 --> 02:02:17.208
all I wanted was
to run to him and hold him close.

02:02:18.208 --> 02:02:21.166
But, sister, it's not as easy
as putting the oath aside

02:02:21.291 --> 02:02:23.958
and indulging in fish curry.

02:02:25.333 --> 02:02:27.875
After all this,
looking Raju in the eye…

02:02:29.958 --> 02:02:30.875
It's over.

02:02:31.833 --> 02:02:33.541
- It's all finished.
- Sathya.

02:02:34.625 --> 02:02:35.916
You stand before Lord Shiva himself.

02:02:36.041 --> 02:02:38.916
Seek His blessings with
all your heart, and He will answer.

02:02:39.291 --> 02:02:41.791
Seek His blessings for one last time.

02:02:42.250 --> 02:02:43.583
What should I wish for?

02:02:44.541 --> 02:02:48.416
A man goes to work
for his family.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.500
If we send them off with our tears,
this would be the outcome.

02:02:53.791 --> 02:02:56.291
If I ask for anything more,
even Lord Shiva would say that

02:02:56.375 --> 02:02:59.291
I'm unworthy of Raju.

02:03:00.583 --> 02:03:01.458
DONATION BOX

02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.500
Everyone is happy. Come on.

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:46.750
Oh my love

02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:52.166
Oh my love

02:03:55.041 --> 02:03:59.166
{\an8}Oh my love

02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:04.458
Oh my love

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:11.625
Hey! Isn't this jailer a nice guy?

02:04:11.708 --> 02:04:13.541
- Did they give you sweets?
- Give me half of it.

02:04:13.625 --> 02:04:15.375
Look at that baby.
She's so cute!

02:04:16.375 --> 02:04:19.000
We had lunch in Pakistan.

02:04:19.083 --> 02:04:20.750
- But we'll have dinner in India.
- Yes.

02:04:20.833 --> 02:04:22.250
{\an8}That won't be an ordinary record to beat.

02:05:00.833 --> 02:05:03.666
{\an8}According to the bilateral agreement
between India and Pakistan,

02:05:04.041 --> 02:05:06.708
the innocent people who are
imprisoned in both countries

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.125
should be freed to go
home to their countries.

02:05:10.416 --> 02:05:12.416
In a moment,
the Pakistan government

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.583
will announce a list of Indians
to be released.

02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:18.208
After their release from
the Karachi Jail,

02:05:18.458 --> 02:05:21.833
they can reach the Wagah Border
tomorrow morning.

02:05:29.833 --> 02:05:31.291
- Sir?
- Yes.

02:05:31.958 --> 02:05:32.791
{\an8}Sir.

02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:39.916
Nakka Bhairavudu.

02:05:40.208 --> 02:05:41.333
{\an8}That's me!

02:05:58.416 --> 02:05:59.625
Nakka Bhairavudu.

02:06:02.541 --> 02:06:03.750
Doodangi Lingaiah.

02:06:03.833 --> 02:06:06.541
Daddha. That's you.
Take your card.

02:06:08.166 --> 02:06:09.041
I'll take your leave.

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:12.625
Kesam Yerraiah.

02:06:15.833 --> 02:06:17.083
Mailapalli Kanakam.

02:06:20.416 --> 02:06:21.791
{\an8}Mailapalli Kanakam.

02:06:28.083 --> 02:06:29.041
Bommadi Raju.

02:06:33.083 --> 02:06:34.208
Bommadi Raju.

02:06:39.791 --> 02:06:40.791
I'll leave, sister.

02:06:41.791 --> 02:06:43.041
Yes. Let's go.

02:06:44.333 --> 02:06:46.458
Brother-in-law is coming after two years.

02:06:46.791 --> 02:06:47.666
Stay back, sister.

02:06:48.250 --> 02:06:50.333
Once back, he'd find me anyway.

02:06:50.958 --> 02:06:52.583
I need to be with you right now.

02:06:54.166 --> 02:06:56.083
Come. Let's go.

02:07:26.833 --> 02:07:27.875
Panta Krishna.

02:07:32.791 --> 02:07:34.166
Lachi, come on!

02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:35.458
They'll read it.
Come on.

02:07:35.541 --> 02:07:36.708
They didn't call me.

02:07:38.833 --> 02:07:40.291
Ma'am, the list is completed.

02:07:40.791 --> 02:07:41.916
List completed.

02:07:48.125 --> 02:07:49.166
Sir, what about me?

02:07:49.791 --> 02:07:52.083
Sir, where's my name?
Please check it.

02:07:58.583 --> 02:08:01.666
Sir, they didn't call
Lachi's name.

02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:03.458
- It's over. I don't know.
- Please check…

02:08:03.541 --> 02:08:05.583
Sir, why did you stop only me?

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.375
{\an8}- What's going on?
- Close it.

02:08:07.458 --> 02:08:09.208
{\an8}Sir, please let me go.

02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:19.000
- Sir! Please…
- I don't know. I'm helpless.

02:08:20.708 --> 02:08:23.125
- Sir, please talk to them.
- Raju, be patient.

02:08:23.208 --> 02:08:24.916
- What is this, ma'am?
- Please send me, sir.

02:08:25.208 --> 02:08:27.791
Didn't the court order
the release of all these 22 men?

02:08:27.875 --> 02:08:28.708
Why is he being held back?

02:08:28.791 --> 02:08:31.750
The Indian Embassy has sent
clear identities for everyone.

02:08:31.875 --> 02:08:33.583
Lakshman's identity is
the only one we didn't receive.

02:08:33.666 --> 02:08:35.833
{\an8}It's an order not to release
anyone without an identity.

02:08:38.958 --> 02:08:40.458
Gentlemen, how can this happen?

02:08:41.958 --> 02:08:43.791
This will become
an international issue.

02:08:43.875 --> 02:08:44.875
Please take care of it.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:49.750
Sir, please.
What wrong has he committed?

02:08:49.833 --> 02:08:51.250
He was caught along with us.

02:08:51.416 --> 02:08:53.583
He took the same route as us.

02:08:53.666 --> 02:08:55.333
Sir, please do something.

02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:56.541
- Sir!
- Ma'am, please.

02:08:56.625 --> 02:08:58.500
If they don't release him,
I'll stay right here.

02:08:58.583 --> 02:08:59.416
Guns down!

02:09:10.083 --> 02:09:11.000
Raju…

02:09:11.291 --> 02:09:12.333
you should leave.

02:09:12.666 --> 02:09:14.458
All of this is my karma.

02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:19.041
My grandma kept insisting
that I get an Aadhaar card.

02:09:19.458 --> 02:09:20.666
I didn't listen to her.

02:09:20.916 --> 02:09:21.916
It's my mistake.

02:09:22.333 --> 02:09:24.375
Nothing will happen to me.
You go ahead.

02:09:24.583 --> 02:09:26.541
You will be released in
three or four days.

02:09:27.375 --> 02:09:29.791
If my grandmother asks about me,
tell her I'll come soon.

02:09:29.875 --> 02:09:30.750
Where should I go?

02:09:31.916 --> 02:09:32.833
Where?

02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:35.541
Twenty-two of us arrived here.

02:09:36.333 --> 02:09:38.583
And all 22 of us should leave from here.

02:09:40.625 --> 02:09:43.083
We should all set foot in Srikakulam,

02:09:43.166 --> 02:09:44.750
but I should be the last one to do so.

02:09:44.833 --> 02:09:46.625
- Do you get it?
- You're right, Raju!

02:09:46.708 --> 02:09:49.208
Raju, listen to me.

02:09:50.375 --> 02:09:52.375
{\an8}All the Indians that came here before,

02:09:52.458 --> 02:09:55.750
{\an8}suffered for many years
and had to stay. Do you understand?

02:09:55.875 --> 02:09:58.375
{\an8}Since the women back home
are stronghearted,

02:09:58.458 --> 02:10:00.208
{\an8}you are going back after two years.

02:10:02.416 --> 02:10:04.166
This is a great opportunity.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.875
All of you must leave.

02:10:07.625 --> 02:10:10.541
The next release might happen
in seven to ten days.

02:10:10.791 --> 02:10:12.833
I'll send him back then.

02:10:15.833 --> 02:10:16.791
Okay, sir.

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:18.208
Just seven to ten days, right?

02:10:18.291 --> 02:10:19.708
I'll stay here until then.

02:10:19.791 --> 02:10:21.208
- Raju…
- Raju, what are you doing?

02:10:23.416 --> 02:10:24.375
Raju.

02:10:25.166 --> 02:10:26.750
Everything doesn't happen
as we want them to.

02:10:27.333 --> 02:10:29.125
We should adjust
to situations accordingly.

02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:31.166
He will return.

02:10:31.875 --> 02:10:33.083
Come with us, Raju.

02:10:33.166 --> 02:10:36.166
- Get up.
- Why are you talking like this?

02:10:36.833 --> 02:10:38.500
Did we stay with them for two years?

02:10:39.375 --> 02:10:41.291
Can't I stay back for him
for another two days?

02:10:41.583 --> 02:10:42.541
You guys leave.

02:10:42.833 --> 02:10:44.125
Raju, listen to me.

02:10:45.125 --> 02:10:46.125
You get started.

02:10:46.625 --> 02:10:47.708
I'll stay back instead.

02:10:48.166 --> 02:10:49.500
You should return to the village now.

02:10:50.208 --> 02:10:51.083
Get up. Come.

02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.458
Hey, Lachi! Don't worry.

02:10:55.083 --> 02:10:56.833
We are going together. That's it.

02:10:58.666 --> 02:11:00.000
How do I tell you?

02:11:01.833 --> 02:11:03.500
If you don't go now

02:11:03.958 --> 02:11:05.708
and do as you please…

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.541
you can no longer be with Sathya!

02:11:08.625 --> 02:11:09.666
She's getting married tomorrow!

02:11:16.708 --> 02:11:18.416
Shut up, Daddha.

02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:20.750
She probably said it
out of anger toward me.

02:11:20.833 --> 02:11:21.708
She won't get married.

02:11:21.791 --> 02:11:22.708
Hey, give me that card!

02:11:24.916 --> 02:11:26.500
Look at this!

02:11:34.208 --> 02:11:38.875
KORACHA'S WEDDING INVITATION
SATHYA WEDS MURALI

02:11:58.166 --> 02:11:59.125
Daddha…

02:12:19.833 --> 02:12:25.541
{\an8}What was my crime?
Why this cruel sentence?

02:12:25.791 --> 02:12:31.500
You silenced my breath
Signed my fate, and cast me away

02:12:31.916 --> 02:12:37.583
I swore no distance
Could tear us apart

02:12:37.958 --> 02:12:43.541
Yet today, I see my own foolish heart

02:12:43.833 --> 02:12:49.625
You vowed to cross seven seas for me

02:12:49.875 --> 02:12:54.708
But left me drowning in sorrow instead

02:12:54.791 --> 02:12:57.416
Just for you

02:12:58.083 --> 02:13:03.375
{\an8}I waited all these days

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.458
My precious
Just for me

02:13:10.083 --> 02:13:15.458
{\an8}All I have left now are my tears

02:13:16.083 --> 02:13:20.708
{\an8}O precious!

02:13:49.333 --> 02:13:50.875
She pierced my heart, Daddha.

02:13:51.250 --> 02:13:52.791
{\an8}I didn't see this coming at all.

02:14:03.125 --> 02:14:04.791
Her heart must've been so broken…

02:14:06.166 --> 02:14:07.833
for her to make such a decision.

02:14:19.791 --> 02:14:21.000
Whatever the reason may be…

02:14:23.875 --> 02:14:25.208
you should never make a woman cry.

02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:28.375
She will hurt you really badly.

02:14:30.625 --> 02:14:31.458
Whatever.

02:14:39.958 --> 02:14:41.541
Why didn't any of you tell me?

02:14:48.791 --> 02:14:50.166
Hey, Raju.

02:14:50.958 --> 02:14:52.125
Don't be disheartened.

02:14:53.541 --> 02:14:55.000
Stand in front of her once.

02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:59.416
If you are with her,
how can she marry someone else?

02:15:00.916 --> 02:15:03.125
Start right now.

02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:05.333
Come. Let's go.

02:15:06.083 --> 02:15:07.166
Come with us, Raju.

02:15:07.416 --> 02:15:08.291
Come on.

02:15:11.041 --> 02:15:11.916
Raju!

02:15:12.125 --> 02:15:13.375
- Brother…
- Hey, Raju!

02:15:13.583 --> 02:15:14.875
- Raju…
- Raju!

02:15:17.583 --> 02:15:18.458
Ma'am!

02:15:19.625 --> 02:15:20.500
Ma'am!

02:15:20.583 --> 02:15:22.875
- What's happening, sir?
- Let me handle this. Please.

02:15:26.541 --> 02:15:27.833
Guards, guns down.

02:15:28.208 --> 02:15:29.125
Back to positions.

02:15:29.416 --> 02:15:32.333
Hey, Lachi. Come, sit here.

02:15:35.333 --> 02:15:37.958
All this talk of love and marriage
is confusing to me, Daddha.

02:15:40.833 --> 02:15:43.708
But unless Lachi leaves from here,
Raju won't budge either.

02:15:43.875 --> 02:15:44.875
What is he doing?

02:15:44.958 --> 02:15:46.541
There's no confusion in this.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:47.875
Raju.

02:15:49.916 --> 02:15:53.333
Once the clock strikes twelve,
we can't release you guys.

02:15:53.708 --> 02:15:55.000
Who knows
when they'll release you again?

02:15:55.083 --> 02:15:56.375
{\an8}Think again.

02:15:56.958 --> 02:15:59.000
{\an8}The girl you love is
getting married back there.

02:16:00.833 --> 02:16:02.208
Think again, Raju.

02:16:05.958 --> 02:16:08.541
Our love decides my marriage.

02:16:10.541 --> 02:16:12.375
But I won't leave him stranded here.

02:16:12.916 --> 02:16:14.458
Raju, will you come with us or not?

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:15.958
He won't come.

02:16:17.375 --> 02:16:18.333
{\an8}He's Thandel!

02:16:19.375 --> 02:16:20.291
{\an8}The leader!

02:16:21.041 --> 02:16:24.875
Even though he was in Pakistan,
he didn't spare Rakim for his pride.

02:16:25.041 --> 02:16:28.875
Even though it was a Pakistani
who was drowning, he saved him.

02:16:29.375 --> 02:16:33.583
How could you expect him
to leave behind one of you?

02:16:34.125 --> 02:16:35.041
He won't.

02:16:35.833 --> 02:16:37.916
If they're not coming,
we're not moving an inch from here.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.750
- Sit.
- Stay seated.

02:16:50.208 --> 02:16:54.083
Ma'am, you are witnessing all of this.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.041
Tell us, what do we do now?
What's the procedure?

02:16:58.291 --> 02:17:01.416
{\an8}We will not let him pass without
his proper Indian photo identity.

02:17:04.083 --> 02:17:05.083
Indian Embassy.

02:17:05.958 --> 02:17:07.000
It's up to you now.

02:17:10.791 --> 02:17:11.625
Okay.

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:27.958
If we don't get them released now,

02:17:28.041 --> 02:17:29.916
the authorities will make it
difficult later.

02:17:33.875 --> 02:17:36.458
We had lunch in Pakistan.

02:17:36.541 --> 02:17:38.000
But we'll have dinner in India.

02:17:38.083 --> 02:17:39.541
That won't be an ordinary record to beat.

02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.791
{\an8}Do anything before 12:00 a.m.

02:17:46.666 --> 02:17:47.500
{\an8}Yes.

02:17:50.416 --> 02:17:52.125
{\an8}Sir, an iris and thumbprint scan

02:17:52.208 --> 02:17:54.291
{\an8}is mandatory to create an identity card.

02:18:11.041 --> 02:18:11.875
{\an8}Sir…

02:18:19.583 --> 02:18:21.125
{\an8}We're running out of time, sir.

02:18:22.083 --> 02:18:25.125
{\an8}We have only one hour left
to get the fishermen released.

02:18:28.833 --> 02:18:29.666
Ma'am!

02:18:34.458 --> 02:18:35.666
Okay. Okay, sir.

02:18:47.291 --> 02:18:48.458
{\an8}What happened, Nizamuddin?

02:18:49.083 --> 02:18:50.375
Sir, it's past 12 o'clock.

02:18:53.708 --> 02:18:56.791
- Man, how could this happen?
- Oh no!

02:19:03.125 --> 02:19:07.375
For the record,
write the release time as 11:55 p.m.

02:19:08.041 --> 02:19:08.875
Sir?

02:19:09.458 --> 02:19:11.958
It's not yet 12:00 a.m. in this country.

02:19:14.083 --> 02:19:15.708
{\an8}- Open the gate.
- Yes, sir.

02:19:18.916 --> 02:19:20.416
{\an8}Please update the same
in your records.

02:19:21.041 --> 02:19:21.958
{\an8}Okay, sir.

02:19:23.666 --> 02:19:24.625
Raju.

02:19:25.458 --> 02:19:28.125
Yeah! Lachi!

02:19:28.291 --> 02:19:30.416
Let's go home.
Come running to us!

02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:50.708
Raju…

02:19:51.166 --> 02:19:54.375
the one who takes the first step forward
to protect his team

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.500
and the last one to set foot on the shores

02:19:58.166 --> 02:19:59.875
{\an8}while rescuing the same team…

02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:01.750
is the Thandel.

02:20:01.833 --> 02:20:02.833
RAMA

02:20:32.125 --> 02:20:33.708
Yes. There they are.

02:20:35.541 --> 02:20:36.916
Come. Please come.

02:20:39.291 --> 02:20:40.375
Come, dear.
Come.

02:20:41.375 --> 02:20:43.708
- How are you, dear?
- Where's Chinni?

02:20:44.375 --> 02:20:47.375
Hey! We are getting married
in 30 minutes. Are you ready?

02:20:48.458 --> 02:20:50.583
What now? You were
ready in Delhi, right?

02:21:10.541 --> 02:21:12.541
If the flag isn't there,
it means Raju has arrived, right?

02:21:15.541 --> 02:21:18.291
When we asked in Delhi
about you becoming a bride,

02:21:18.375 --> 02:21:20.250
I thought I'd be your husband.

02:21:20.625 --> 02:21:21.791
But I realized later that it was

02:21:22.041 --> 02:21:24.583
to get rid of all obstacles for Raju.

02:21:27.041 --> 02:21:29.000
I paid for the flight ticket
and brought him here.

02:21:44.083 --> 02:21:47.541
You should only take what you
can afford to repay in installments.

02:21:47.791 --> 02:21:51.166
It's not right to wish
for things beyond that.

02:21:53.625 --> 02:21:55.958
It's sad to let go of a girl like you.

02:21:56.333 --> 02:21:57.291
But there's nothing I can do.

02:21:58.416 --> 02:22:01.083
If you want to do
something nice for me,

02:22:02.291 --> 02:22:05.250
pay for the flight ticket
charges and other expenses.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.875
I'll settle all that with Uncle.
I mean, your father.

02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:16.375
Can I leave now?

02:22:17.083 --> 02:22:18.708
When have you ever stayed?

02:22:37.083 --> 02:22:40.333
Like a flag dancing wild in the wind

02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:46.000
My heart dances with joy at your return

02:22:46.333 --> 02:22:50.416
Like a boat finally reaching the shore

02:22:50.916 --> 02:22:55.125
My world erupts, seeing you once more

02:22:55.625 --> 02:23:00.166
I've waited forever
Longing to see you

02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:04.083
One glimpse is all I need

02:23:04.166 --> 02:23:05.416
Just for you

02:23:07.083 --> 02:23:10.166
I've been waiting with all my heart

02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:14.750
This precious one
Just for you

02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:19.416
Has hidden every ounce of love

02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:23.750
Your precious one

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.708
Sorry for taking it this far.

02:23:30.791 --> 02:23:32.250
You should apologize as well now.

02:23:40.208 --> 02:23:43.750
I was planning to go straight
to the wedding and enjoy the feast.

02:23:44.916 --> 02:23:48.583
But since your dad is frugal,
the food might not be that great.

02:23:49.833 --> 02:23:52.000
That's why I came straight here.
Now, get lost!

02:23:53.166 --> 02:23:54.083
Yeah, right!

02:23:54.166 --> 02:23:56.916
I rushed from D Matchilesam to Delhi
only to get lost!

02:23:58.541 --> 02:23:59.833
I went to Wagah Border.

02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:02.291
I picked a fight at Veeravali Port.

02:24:03.875 --> 02:24:06.875
I prayed daily to Shiva and Parvati
asking them to set you free!

02:24:06.958 --> 02:24:08.625
All for what? To leave you?

02:24:11.583 --> 02:24:12.500
Hey!

02:24:15.041 --> 02:24:16.916
How many tanks of water
do you carry inside you?

02:24:19.833 --> 02:24:20.791
I don't understand!

02:24:21.333 --> 02:24:23.666
Streams of tears
are flowing from your eyes!

02:24:24.625 --> 02:24:26.958
- I'm leaving now.
- My precious…

02:24:27.708 --> 02:24:30.541
- Let go! Let me go!
- I won't. No.

02:24:31.125 --> 02:24:32.250
- My precious!
- Leave…

02:24:33.250 --> 02:24:34.291
I'm here now.

02:24:36.583 --> 02:24:37.625
Please smile.

02:24:52.333 --> 02:24:55.625

I AM EAGERLY WAITING TO SEE MY HUSBAND

02:25:27.041 --> 02:25:29.125

02:25:29.208 --> 02:25:30.541
HEALTH IS DETERIORATING

THE PEOPLE AROUND
