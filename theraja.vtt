00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:05.128
Now close your eyes.

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.782
Take a deep breath.

00:00:11.488 --> 00:00:14.571
Your brain follows only my commands.

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:40.834
Oh gosh! He killed them!

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:53.064
Grandpa.

00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:58.076
Come. I'll introduce you.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:02.291
-Introduce?! What are you saying?
-Then stop staring and run, guys!

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:15.424
-Remove it!
-Why the sudden shift in climate?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.795
You must just enjoy grandpa's wonders.
You shouldn't question them.

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:23.779
I must do something unforgettable.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.687
It should become a sensation.

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.399
Everyone must be stunned thinking,
"How did this guy pull this off?"

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.792
I can't take this anymore.
Mother Durga! Please protect my grandson.

00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:55.888
He's not just some street magician
who knows a few spells.

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:59.069
He's an exorcist,
a psychiatrist, and a hypnotist.

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:02.216
He's playing with our brains.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:05.931
Then let's settle this with the star!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.850
Star to star.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.309
Star Wars!

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:35.175
It's impossible to face him.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.491
See for yourself now.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.849
What's your problem?

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:10.209
Am I an ant that would sting
when you reach into the anthill?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.198
I'm the demon!

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.083
BEEP
