WEBVTT

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:36.597
They always play the same channel!

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.628
They never switch channels!
-That's enough for me!

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.204
Don't waste any of it, alright?
-Here.

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:44.313
Quiet in the back!

00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:51.833
Amudha!
-Is this enough or do you want more?

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:53.837
Amudha!

00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:57.468
Ma'am?
-Come here.

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:00.587
Leave the plate.
I'll wash it.

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:02.613
Leave it there.
Come here.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.447
Don't play much tonight.

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:06.102
Go to bed soon, alright?

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:08.298
Why?
-Somebody important is coming...

00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:09.754
...to visit you tomorrow.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:10.962
To visit me?
-Yes.

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.087
Who is it, ma'am?

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:14.844
You'll find out when you wake up
tomorrow. Go sleep.

00:02:15.587 --> 00:02:17.352
Play carefully!
You may fall down and hurt yourselves!

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:27.337
Sister! If there are no parents,
who else would come to visit me from home?

00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:30.337
Besides parents,
many of the uncles come to visit.

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:34.962
And the women they marry. The aunts.
Those kind of people come along.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.629
Forgot to mention it.

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:40.545
I mentioned everyone.
What if your grandparents are coming?

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.504
When they visit tomorrow,
wear some nice clothes.

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:48.962
Do you have any?
-Yes, I do.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.670
Loosen your hand.

00:03:42.462 --> 00:03:43.571
Count these, too.
-Alright.

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:50.045
Relax.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:04.342
Cross-check it and clear the container.
-Alright.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.435
Sir?

00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:11.174
Sir?

00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.212
We cracked open a tile.

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:15.920
100% pure cocaine
was concealed in the tile, sir.

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:18.045
How many kilograms?
-Almost one ton, sir.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.504
900 kilograms.

00:04:19.548 --> 00:04:21.795
It will definitely be worth
over 800 crores, sir.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.920
Undoubtedly the biggest drug bust ever.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.716
Boys!

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.212
I don't know how many lives this drug bust
will claim by sunrise.

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:38.016
Until I get word from Narayanan
or the OPG head, no one must know of this.

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:41.166
That includes your family, too.
-Yes, sir!

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:42.754
Only Thiru's phone stays on.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.670
He must be the only contact person.
-Yes, sir!

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:46.490
Take no calls except the ones
that come from my number.

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:47.646
-Yes, sir!
-Ok

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:50.462
Anbu...
Trust me, Anbu!

00:04:51.882 --> 00:04:54.754
I gave the signal
as soon as the vehicle crossed the gate!

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.295
I'm not at fault!
Don't know how the cops got there, Anbu!

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.587
Listen up! My entire cargo's gone!
-I don't know...

00:05:00.712 --> 00:05:04.087
And you've been blubbering repeatedly
like some raving lunatic!

00:05:05.712 --> 00:05:07.004
Ask anyone, Anbu!

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:09.337
Admit it.

00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:11.712
I'll spare you.
-I swear upon my son, Anbu!

00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:13.587
Don't know how things went wrong!

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:14.962
Trust me, Anbu!

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:17.254
I gave the signal as soon as
the vehicle crossed!

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:18.712
Trust me, Anbu!

00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:20.462
Don't do anything to me, Anbu!

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:21.754
I'm not at fault, Anbu!

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.837
Trust me! I gave the signal
as soon as the vehicle crossed!

00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:25.962
Is Anbu there?

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:29.420
Tell him, brother! You know me, right?
-Anbu.

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.379
You tell him, brother!
Please!

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:33.754
Talk to him.

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:36.254
Who is it?

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.110
What gives?
Stumped after giving away all your cocaine?

00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:40.763
Who are you?

00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:42.849
I know where your cocaine is.

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:45.295
Adaikalam's younger brother, right?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.837
I need to speak to your older brother.
Set it up.

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:50.087
He won't talk.
Tell me if you have a deal in mind.

00:05:50.212 --> 00:05:53.004
Don't know how the cops came, brother!
I swear!

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.329
Please let me go, brother!
I did nothing wrong!

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.212
I'll tell you where your cocaine is.

00:05:58.337 --> 00:06:02.254
To ensure the cops don't interfere,
I'll need twenty kilos of it.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.587
You know how much twenty kilos
is worth in the market?

00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:06.587
I don't know
how much twenty kilos is worth.

00:06:06.712 --> 00:06:09.254
But I know how much 900 kilos
is worth.

00:06:10.254 --> 00:06:12.462
I can't do this all by myself.

00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:16.754
Narcotics Division. Forest Department.
The Inspector General's Office.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.087
All must be handled!

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:19.379
Plenty of risk at my end!

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.313
A lot of people
must be compensated!

00:06:23.504 --> 00:06:26.087
If twenty kilos is acceptable,
we can talk further.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:29.879
Tell him, man!

00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:31.462
Please tell him!

00:06:31.587 --> 00:06:34.295
He gave the signal
when the vehicle crossed, brother!

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.212
Yes, I did!
-Really?

00:06:36.337 --> 00:06:37.337
He gave it, huh?

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:46.337
Never mind twenty.
Take how much ever you want!

00:06:46.462 --> 00:06:49.129
But I need to know the scumbags
who seized my drugs!

00:06:49.254 --> 00:06:50.629
They must die tonight!

00:06:50.754 --> 00:06:53.629
A cop must consider the consequences
of entering Adaikalam's area!

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.420
So must the entire police force!

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.212
No one near is picking up, Anbu.

00:07:03.337 --> 00:07:04.754
The boss's phone is off, too.

00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:10.920
If my brother still hasn't come yet,
something's up.

00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:20.195
Has everyone reached
the I.G.'s guesthouse, Paul Pandi?

00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:22.837
Not yet, sir.

00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:25.254
They're tricking in one by one.
Yes, sir.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.670
Do you believe someone can become
a millionaire overnight?

00:07:28.795 --> 00:07:30.379
Oh, man!
I get it now, sir!

00:07:30.504 --> 00:07:32.295
This is one such night!

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.837
If done right,
you're set for life!

00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:37.712
Miss even by an inch,
they'll take you and your family out!

00:07:37.837 --> 00:07:40.420
Watch it.
-Got it, sir. It won't miss.

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:44.170
What?
-Just a minute.

00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:49.670
What is your problem?

00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:51.754
Don't you get it the first time around?

00:07:52.754 --> 00:07:54.462
Why call repeatedly
and bother me so?

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:58.129
Bejoy.
The squad head.

00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:01.170
His squad
has four men.

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:06.045
Thiru, Sudhakar,
Joseph and Kumaran.

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:10.379
I'll kill those five men before dawn!

00:08:10.504 --> 00:08:12.629
Send me all their details!
Hello?

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:15.295
Hello?
Still there, sir?

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:18.504
Not just five people you must kill.

00:08:20.212 --> 00:08:22.545
What?
-There is an informant in your gang.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.545
No chance. Every one of them...
-He's there!

00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:30.295
One of them has been passing information
to Bejoy for two years!

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.962
Why bother the hell out of me like this?

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:36.462
Sir! Sir! Sir!

00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:38.587
Their entire cocaine
amounts to 900 kilos!

00:08:38.712 --> 00:08:40.504
Got any information
about 'Ghost'?

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:42.837
I was saying something.
You're on something else!

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:46.670
Because of the information I gave,
they needlessly killed a man!

00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:49.330
I have trouble breathing!
Scared I'll get busted, sir!

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:51.420
Just listen to me, Ajaz!
-I can't do it anymore!

00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:53.837
I'll surrender at the nearest precinct!
-Idiot!

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.420
Is any of this new to you?

00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:58.556
You've been undercover
for 26 months!

00:08:59.212 --> 00:09:00.795
Have you ever seen Adaikalam?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.795
Does anyone even know
what he looks like?

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.629
They don't, right?
We've seized 900 kilos!

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.712
He must definitely come out
into the open!

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.962
One last chance, Ajaz!

00:09:10.087 --> 00:09:12.212
We've worked for over two years
for this night!

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:14.129
How many cops have died?
-Sir...

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:16.640
Please just hear me out, sir...
-Listen, Ajaz!

00:09:17.587 --> 00:09:19.295
Found out who that man is?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.337
How can that be done
so quickly?

00:09:21.462 --> 00:09:24.504
They must be tracked.
Many must be interrogated.

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:25.879
It's not that easy.

00:09:26.004 --> 00:09:28.420
Can't take any chances
with it. What do you say?

00:09:28.513 --> 00:09:30.879
You're right.
Point out the black sheep to me.

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.224
I'll slit him up!

00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:45.295
Hey! Call and find out
if he's in Shankar's hood.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.087
Sure, brother.
-Spare no one who came in yesterday!

00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:51.045
Get everyone here now!
-Guys have gone out. We'll get him.

00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:53.254
Please understand, sir!

00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:56.420
Please, sir...
-Ajaz!

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:58.254
I must know what's going on there!

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:00.837
Report to me whenever you can.
That's a bloody order!

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:02.094
I swear I can't...

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:06.629
I'll call you back, dear.

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:10.295
Sampath...
-Yes, Anbu?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.254
There is a cop among us.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.795
Do you suspect anyone?

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.129
No, Anbu.

00:10:16.254 --> 00:10:18.254
There can't be such a thing.
-There is!

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:20.379
He takes my grub
and snitches me out!

00:10:21.962 --> 00:10:25.712
What do we do?
-Call in everyone from our gang tonight.

00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:27.670
I know who the five cops are.

00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:30.254
We must deliver their heads
to the station by tonight!

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.118
Alright, I'll take care of it.

00:10:32.462 --> 00:10:34.837
Hey, Chandra!
-Tell me, Sampath!

00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:37.712
Gather around, everyone!
-Wait! Let me stack these up!

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:39.379
Drop it and come here!

00:10:39.504 --> 00:10:41.087
Need a quick chat!
Come here, guys!

00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:46.129
Did a brown container with the number plate
'TN-45 KA-9072' come this way?

00:10:46.254 --> 00:10:47.462
Just a minute.

00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:48.657
Yes! It did, sir!

00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:50.349
When did it cross by?
-7 PM.

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:57.254
Pull over.

00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:11.379
Where's the file
of that motel case?

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:14.629
The Inspector will ask for it
first thing in the morning! Have it up?

00:11:14.754 --> 00:11:16.545
I've filled it up.
Look it over anyway.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.087
Alright, I'll check it up.

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:19.696
I'll get going, sir.
-Alright.

00:11:24.254 --> 00:11:25.962
Greetings, sir.

00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:29.305
My name is Napoleon. I'm a constable
from the Tirunelveli district.

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:32.251
I need to see Mr. Manickavel.
Just got transferred here.

00:11:32.337 --> 00:11:34.379
Need to know which station
I'm posted...

00:11:34.504 --> 00:11:36.629
Oh, you're that guy. He talked about it.
-Yes.

00:11:36.754 --> 00:11:39.670
Why did you come at night?
-Didn't expect it to be this far, sir.

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:41.629
Should I be on duty
for tomorrow?

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:43.670
Hey!
Who are you?

00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:45.629
Slapping people
in the police station!

00:11:45.754 --> 00:11:48.295
Is that your sister?
-He guessed right!

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.295
Keep laughing
and I'll break your teeth!

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.670
I'm lenient
because you're just students!

00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:55.337
Sir?
-What is it?

00:11:55.462 --> 00:11:58.212
They're from my college.
Friends of mine.

00:11:58.337 --> 00:12:00.337
Came to pick them up?
-"Pick them up"?

00:12:00.462 --> 00:12:02.837
Is this is a school?
Do you know what they did?

00:12:02.962 --> 00:12:06.087
They got drunk and were dancing
to loud music on the railway platform!

00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:08.837
Got a complaint from the control room
and brought them here!

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.587
Sit down. Take it up with the Inspector
when he gets here!

00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:14.861
He knows the Inspector, sir...
-Everyone says that! Sit down!

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.240
Sit in the corner!
-Come, Tamizh!

00:12:19.962 --> 00:12:23.790
Just that it's been two years since
the new Commissioner's office was built.

00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:26.536
The Chief Minister hasn't inaugurated it.
So, it's still closed!

00:12:29.164 --> 00:12:30.062
Sir!

00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:31.712
Belongs to those kids, sir!

00:12:31.837 --> 00:12:33.129
Ah, I see.

00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:35.712
The higher-ups have gone
for an urgent meeting.

00:12:35.837 --> 00:12:38.087
It'll be a while for them to get back.
Go have a seat.

00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:39.212
Alright.

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:47.810
Sir! They may assign you to a rural area.
Ask for a posting in the city!

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:52.089
Money will flow! Even if it's
your last kickback, you'd get plenty!

00:12:55.837 --> 00:12:56.837
Tamizh...

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.170
Tamizh...

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.670
I'm sorry.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.587
It has crossed, sir!

00:13:07.712 --> 00:13:09.337
At what time?
-8:30 PM, sir.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.129
The crossing time at four toll booths
is accurate!

00:13:13.254 --> 00:13:16.587
Only between the fourth and fifth booth,
it took two hours, sir.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:17.712
Alright, hang up.

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:32.545
Good evening, sir.

00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:37.212
What's wrong with your hand, sir?
-Small accident this morning.

00:13:37.337 --> 00:13:41.004
Still on duty or are you off?
-I wrapped up duty and was heading home.

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:44.670
On the way, I saw a constable
from the station yelling at a guy.

00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:46.754
When we asked him,
he had no ID.

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:49.754
The guy had a beard and looked suspicious,
sir.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:51.920
He wouldn't look me in the eye, sir.

00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:55.212
So, I put him in my jeep. Will question
and release him in the morning, sir.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.962
Is he handcuffed?
-Yes, sir.

00:14:09.795 --> 00:14:11.004
900 kilos?

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:13.045
How much is it worth in the market?
-Sir...

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:15.712
Approximately 840 crores.

00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:18.504
Any information about that gang?

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:21.170
Adaikalam
and his so-called brother Anbu, sir.

00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:23.795
Under them, there are two more guys:
Tips and Ram.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.379
No one in this entire gang
knows what Adaikalam looks like.

00:14:27.504 --> 00:14:30.920
The master plan of picking a low-key city
like this, turning it into a hub...

00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:34.587
...and flooding the society with drugs,
is all Adaikalam's handiwork.

00:14:34.712 --> 00:14:38.795
In the last two years alone, eleven cops
who worked on this case, were killed.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.587
We know these guys did it.
Yet, we can't do anything.

00:14:41.712 --> 00:14:45.795
What to do, sir? There are many
in our department who work for them.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.504
They are extremely dangerous, sir.

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:50.609
We've seized not just drugs,
but a lot of explosives, too!

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:53.962
You won't believe, sir.
They even had a gattling gun!

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:58.587
Just that the seven guys who were caught
were low level thugs from the gang, sir.

00:14:58.712 --> 00:15:02.071
They handle transportation, supply
and such. They know nothing, sir.

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:08.420
Let's go.
-That's Rohypnol. A high sedative.

00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:10.920
Don't mix more than five milliliters
in any bottle.

00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:14.254
Once consumed, it takes fifteen minutes
to take effect.

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:17.314
But one can regain consciousness
only after eight hours!

00:15:18.254 --> 00:15:19.795
Who's the informant?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.533
My boy, sir.
Ajaz Ahmed.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.379
Tell him to be careful!

00:15:24.004 --> 00:15:26.129
No one knows where the drugs are, right?

00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:28.254
Just you, me and my boys.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:36.337
Is the Commissioner's office a safe spot?
-No place in the city is safer, sir.

00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:42.379
As the office is an old British building,
there's a secret basement below, sir.

00:15:42.504 --> 00:15:47.004
Until we have it on record,
the evidence we seized will be held there.

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:51.962
In fact, no one in law and order
even knows that such a place exists, sir!

00:15:52.087 --> 00:15:53.650
It's completely safe, sir.

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:57.931
Step out.
Go have a drink, guys!

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.045
Hey! Their training is almost over.
Just one day, right? Let them go.

00:16:06.337 --> 00:16:07.337
Sir!

00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:13.004
I'll say it again. Don't put more than
five milliliters in any bottle.

00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:16.876
Even if it's up by one point,
it can cause death by overdose. Watch it.

00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.962
This is a major case.

00:16:25.087 --> 00:16:29.884
Can't pull off a consignment this big,
without political involvement.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.087
For some political reasons...

00:16:33.254 --> 00:16:36.004
...it won't be surprising
if we have to give these back.

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:37.196
Sir?

00:16:37.545 --> 00:16:38.959
Tell your boys to be safe.

00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:41.129
Nothing about this
must leak out.

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:45.379
You know what would happen
if all these drugs reach society, sir...

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:47.837
Hey!
I was speaking hypothetically.

00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:50.337
It is a possibility.
Try to understand.

00:16:50.462 --> 00:16:52.129
Come gulp down two large shots.

00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:54.170
No, sir.
I'm under medication.

00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:56.610
Alright!
At least give me company!

00:17:06.462 --> 00:17:07.754
Sir!

00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:10.462
What's up?
Everyone's here, right?

00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:12.087
I retire in a month.

00:17:13.004 --> 00:17:16.379
Think they'll get that damn Nagaraj
as my replacement.

00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:18.254
Tiruchy's about to witness a new dawn!

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:29.212
Couldn't hang out with you
at my son's wedding.

00:17:29.337 --> 00:17:32.879
Plenty of protests that time, too.
You guys were busy with it, as well.

00:17:33.004 --> 00:17:35.504
This small party is to celebrate
both these events.

00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:40.712
Also, I've recommended eleven people
for promotion.

00:17:40.837 --> 00:17:41.837
It will come soon.

00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:45.754
Don't just stand there! Get started!
Enough with the formalities!

00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:48.670
Be sure to inform the station!

00:17:53.462 --> 00:17:56.016
The names of five cops
are in this paper!

00:17:56.712 --> 00:17:58.379
The one who brings me
their heads...

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.087
...gets a settlement
of a lifetime!

00:18:02.212 --> 00:18:05.254
All those bloody cops
are at the Inspector General's guest house!

00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:06.920
Their deaths will make...

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.504
...any cop who even thinks
of messing with us...

00:18:09.629 --> 00:18:10.712
...shiver in fear!

00:18:10.837 --> 00:18:13.045
This is an open challenge!
Take it on if you dare!

00:18:39.712 --> 00:18:41.129
Cheers!

00:18:44.462 --> 00:18:46.254
Don't be shy! Just have it.
-No thanks.

00:18:55.004 --> 00:18:56.004
Cheers!

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.420
Cheers!

00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:12.045
Excuse me.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.129
All going perfectly, sir!
They've started drinking.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.920
I'll call back, sir.

00:19:26.337 --> 00:19:28.254
Confirmed that this is where
the stuff is?

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:32.087
Take half of our guys
and get going.

00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:35.657
I'll clear out the rest of the stuff...

00:19:36.795 --> 00:19:38.879
...and track down the place
where the boss is.

00:19:39.004 --> 00:19:41.633
We can reclaim the cargo
before he gets back.

00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:47.754
Let's go.

00:19:54.587 --> 00:19:55.712
Anbu!

00:19:55.837 --> 00:19:58.670
The guys are ready!
You didn't tell us where the stuff is.

00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:35.295
Sir!

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:39.545
What happened, Joseph?
-Sir!

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.254
Sir...
-Move aside!

00:20:45.795 --> 00:20:48.087
Don't do it, sir!
-Hold him off, sir!

00:20:48.744 --> 00:20:50.562
What happened?
-Look there!

00:20:50.587 --> 00:20:52.295
Someone's driving away
in the jeep, sir!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.129
Stop!

00:20:57.754 --> 00:20:59.415
Look up, sir!
-Are you okay?

00:21:03.337 --> 00:21:04.515
Somebody catch him!

00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:11.205
Sir!

00:21:12.295 --> 00:21:13.337
Sir!

00:21:13.462 --> 00:21:14.504
What?
-Come look, sir!

00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:16.379
Where's the I.G.?
-He passed out, sir!

00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:18.185
Sir...Sir..

00:21:21.879 --> 00:21:23.004
What happened, sir?

00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:26.045
You're bleeding! They drugged
our drinks or our water, sir!

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.337
Commissioner's office is under attack!
It's a trap! What do we do, sir?

00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:31.504
Folks from law and order, and crime
are here, yes?

00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:34.462
Shall I inform the railway police
and CB-CID, sir?

00:21:34.587 --> 00:21:37.670
Don't!
Let no one know about this.

00:21:37.795 --> 00:21:42.504
We can lose the drugs.
But not a single cop must lose his life!

00:21:42.629 --> 00:21:46.379
If the media finds out,
it'll embarrass the entire department!

00:21:46.504 --> 00:21:47.920
Do something!

00:21:48.045 --> 00:21:50.962
I wanted to retire with dignity.

00:21:51.087 --> 00:21:53.004
I must have that!
Please do something!

00:21:53.129 --> 00:21:55.337
Please!
-Is any one out there?

00:21:56.004 --> 00:21:57.004
Hey!

00:21:58.212 --> 00:22:00.837
No one eat or drink anything!
Throw away everything!

00:22:00.962 --> 00:22:02.837
Alright, sir!
-What do we do with them?

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.420
Hold on.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.879
Patience.
Be careful!

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.170
Hold on!

00:22:14.795 --> 00:22:15.795
Hey, Kamatchi!

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.712
Whose truck is this?
-Our truck, sir.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:19.587
Catering truck.
-Where's the driver?

00:22:19.712 --> 00:22:23.129
As he only had to drive tomorrow,
he boozed and ended up like these guys!

00:22:23.254 --> 00:22:24.962
Do you drive?
-Can't drive a truck, sir!

00:22:25.087 --> 00:22:26.879
You?
-I can only ride two-wheelers.

00:22:27.004 --> 00:22:29.004
And you?
-I don't know how to drive a truck, sir.

00:22:29.129 --> 00:22:30.795
Check if there's anyone in the back!

00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:34.920
What happened to them, sir?
-It doesn't concern you.

00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:36.545
Just do what you're told. Now go!

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.629
No one here either, sir!

00:22:48.295 --> 00:22:50.670
The guy had a beard and looked suspicious,
sir.

00:22:51.587 --> 00:22:53.629
He wouldn't look me in the eye, sir.

00:22:53.754 --> 00:22:56.920
So, I put him in my jeep. Will question
and release him in the morning, sir.

00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:08.087
Hey!
Do you know how to drive?

00:23:09.212 --> 00:23:10.295
Hey! I'm talking to you!

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.170
Can you drive a truck?

00:23:13.295 --> 00:23:14.587
Are you deaf?

00:23:14.712 --> 00:23:16.587
Hey!
Do you hear me or not?

00:23:18.837 --> 00:23:21.110
Hey!
Do you know to drive or not?

00:23:23.837 --> 00:23:24.732
Okay...

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920
Step out.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.295
Go start that truck up!

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.962
The Commissioner's office
is 80 kilometers away.

00:24:12.087 --> 00:24:13.337
Drop me there and take off.

00:24:13.462 --> 00:24:16.564
I'll see to it there's no case
against you. Go it? Go!

00:24:19.212 --> 00:24:20.545
What?

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:21.712
Can't do it.

00:24:22.254 --> 00:24:23.712
You said you knew how to drive.

00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:24.837
I did say that.

00:24:25.712 --> 00:24:27.462
Never said I would do it.

00:24:27.587 --> 00:24:30.795
What the hell, man? You raise your voice
after I took off your cuffs?

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.337
How could I not, sir?

00:24:32.462 --> 00:24:33.837
Is it a crime
to have a beard?

00:24:33.962 --> 00:24:36.504
Your guy roughly pulled
at my brand new shirt!

00:24:36.629 --> 00:24:38.045
It got torn, too!

00:24:39.754 --> 00:24:42.795
If someone from the government says so,
your guy said he'd let me go.

00:24:43.462 --> 00:24:45.268
Here. Talk to her.

00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:47.044
Hello!

00:24:47.045 --> 00:24:48.879
Hey Dilli!
Got into the bus?

00:24:49.004 --> 00:24:51.004
I'm not Dilli.
I'm Bejoy.

00:24:51.129 --> 00:24:52.587
Special Task Force.

00:24:52.712 --> 00:24:53.712
Who's he to you?

00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:57.127
I'm Nalini.
Probation officer. Puzhal Jail.

00:24:58.545 --> 00:25:00.587
Is he a convict?
-He was.

00:25:00.712 --> 00:25:01.751
Not anymore.

00:25:02.212 --> 00:25:04.004
He was serving a life sentence.

00:25:04.129 --> 00:25:06.170
Four years were cut off
by remission.

00:25:06.295 --> 00:25:09.462
He served ten years in prison
and was just released today.

00:25:09.587 --> 00:25:12.319
He has a release order with him.
Didn't you see it?

00:25:12.437 --> 00:25:15.379
Convicts shouldn't have beards.
How is this, ma'am?

00:25:15.504 --> 00:25:17.670
Special petition, sir.
For a pilgrimage!

00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:19.587
First tell me your problem!

00:25:19.712 --> 00:25:21.379
An emergency here, ma'am!

00:25:21.504 --> 00:25:24.212
A truck must be driven for 80 kilometers.
No one else here.

00:25:24.337 --> 00:25:27.879
I asked him to drive and he refuses.
You're a G.O., right? Tell him!

00:25:28.004 --> 00:25:30.629
Why must Dilli drive the truck?
He won't do it!

00:25:30.754 --> 00:25:32.004
Let him go!

00:25:32.129 --> 00:25:34.688
Please listen to me, ma'am...
-Sir!

00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:37.379
Listen carefully to what I say.

00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:40.170
He hasn't seen his child in ten years.

00:25:40.295 --> 00:25:46.754
After so long, we just got to know
that she's at an ashram in Perambalur.

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:50.423
Tomorrow morning, he's going to meet
his daughter for the first time.

00:25:50.962 --> 00:25:53.587
Why do you drag him
into your mess, sir?

00:25:53.712 --> 00:25:54.879
Ma'am...

00:25:55.004 --> 00:25:57.087
Every convict has a justification.

00:25:57.212 --> 00:25:58.962
But this is a serious situation!

00:25:59.087 --> 00:26:00.879
Involves the lives of many cops!

00:26:01.004 --> 00:26:02.665
Please tell him to drive!

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.670
Talk to her.

00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:09.879
Hello?
-Dilli...

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.844
Listen to what that cop wants and help...
-Ma'am...

00:26:14.629 --> 00:26:15.798
I can't do it, ma'am.

00:26:16.962 --> 00:26:18.985
The life I lost
has just begun again.

00:26:20.337 --> 00:26:21.879
Please don't compel me, ma'am.

00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:26.509
I'll call you after I get on the bus.
-No, Dilli...

00:26:28.795 --> 00:26:30.545
I'll ask you for the last time.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.129
Will you drive or not?

00:26:32.254 --> 00:26:34.420
Un-cuff me, sir.
I must get going.

00:26:35.879 --> 00:26:37.087
I'm screaming my head off!

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:40.045
It's that release order in your pocket,
right? Look here!

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.384
Get charged with even a petty crime
in the next 3 years, it'll be nixed!

00:26:43.493 --> 00:26:45.170
You'll be sent back to jail!
Know it, right?

00:26:46.837 --> 00:26:48.295
I know where your child is.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.670
One phone call's enough.

00:26:49.795 --> 00:26:52.795
I can have her transferred to another home
overnight!

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.504
It'll take you ten years to even find out
where she is! Shall I do it?

00:26:56.629 --> 00:26:58.087
Or will you start the truck?

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.587
Thought you'd let me go
if I told the truth.

00:27:04.212 --> 00:27:06.004
You had to play the cop game!
-Why not?

00:27:06.129 --> 00:27:09.754
Like only you have a family!
Do you only consider yourself to be human?

00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:11.379
Don't cops have families, too?

00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:13.629
This is night!
Cops aren't on the beat tonight!

00:27:13.754 --> 00:27:16.920
Read in tomorrow's paper of the crimes
that go down tonight! You'll get it!

00:27:17.045 --> 00:27:19.009
Cops on duty
were drinking.

00:27:20.212 --> 00:27:23.170
Will the news also report that a convict
dropped them at the precinct?

00:27:23.297 --> 00:27:25.321
Do you want to see your daughter or not?

00:27:38.193 --> 00:27:41.985
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:27:43.401 --> 00:27:46.024
Sister?
-What is it?

00:27:46.401 --> 00:27:49.930
How many more hours left
until ten o'clock in the morning?

00:27:50.485 --> 00:27:53.110
First, put away the clock
and go to sleep.

00:27:53.235 --> 00:27:55.681
If Ma'am comes for rounds,
you'll get in trouble!

00:28:36.776 --> 00:28:39.193
Hey! Do you know how to drive a truck
or not?

00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.068
Oh God!

00:29:02.776 --> 00:29:04.474
What's wrong?
-Sir...

00:29:04.901 --> 00:29:06.776
It doesn't brake properly.

00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:09.818
All four wheels are shaking.
Third gear isn't working right.

00:29:09.943 --> 00:29:12.458
Don't know if it can go 80 kilometers, sir.
-Sir!...

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.610
I swear to God the truck just got insured
and was issued a safety certificate!

00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:18.401
This guy doesn't know how to drive!
It's in great shape, sir!

00:29:18.526 --> 00:29:20.485
Do we drive around
without knowing all this?

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.901
Go ask what's up!
-Who are you?

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:24.974
Look at the board.
I'm the Kamatchi mentioned there!

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:26.681
I own this truck!
-Fine!

00:29:26.727 --> 00:29:29.629
Don't do anything unless I say so.
Go stand there!

00:29:30.098 --> 00:29:33.060
Carefully carry each officer
into the truck.

00:29:33.802 --> 00:29:37.312
Listen up. No matter what,
don't tell anyone what happened here.

00:29:37.437 --> 00:29:41.020
If you do, I'll arrest you
and your entire family!

00:29:41.266 --> 00:29:42.831
Alright.
-Go help with this.

00:29:47.113 --> 00:29:48.488
Let's go!

00:29:48.676 --> 00:29:49.594
Go inside!

00:29:52.232 --> 00:29:54.240
Lift them up slowly.

00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:06.478
Come along!
All convicts stand in line!

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.436
Stand in line, I say!

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.834
What kind of reaction did they have,
Bejoy?

00:30:32.959 --> 00:30:36.376
Both pulse and heartbeat
are elevated, doctor.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:38.334
Some of them even vomitted blood.

00:30:38.459 --> 00:30:40.917
Bleeding from the ears, too.
I'm a little scared.

00:30:41.042 --> 00:30:42.251
Alright, listen.

00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:44.209
You're aware of sedative drugs, right?

00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:48.941
Brotizolam, Midazolum,
Ketamine and Rohypnol.

00:30:49.403 --> 00:30:53.068
If any of these is mixed with alcohol,
there'd be this type of reaction.

00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:57.602
If treated within five hours,
they can be saved, Bejoy.

00:30:58.731 --> 00:31:00.856
If not, it'll be very difficult.

00:31:00.981 --> 00:31:02.856
There are chances of cardiac arrest.

00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:05.231
I can't come by the highway.

00:31:05.356 --> 00:31:07.314
And no one must know about this incident.

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:09.023
It's a bit complicated to explain.

00:31:09.648 --> 00:31:12.314
Send me the location. I'll get there soon.
-Hurry.

00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:17.396
Vignesh! Keep my bag inside
and see how many beds are available.

00:31:17.656 --> 00:31:18.698
We may need extra beds.

00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:21.364
Hold the legs! Uncle

00:31:22.994 --> 00:31:25.323
That's it. Just let them lie.
-Go!

00:31:46.105 --> 00:31:49.147
Place them like that and it won't hold!
Lay them down! Come, uncle!

00:31:50.355 --> 00:31:51.772
Just a minute, sir!

00:31:51.897 --> 00:31:53.605
How do I turn this crap off?

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.605
Press the first button!

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.050
Not the second. The first!
That's it!

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.527
Hello! Tell me, sir.

00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:03.273
Muthu! How many of you are on duty
at the Commissioner's office?

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:05.659
Me and three other constables
on night duty.

00:32:05.732 --> 00:32:06.774
And in the office?

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:08.776
Everyone in the office has left!

00:32:08.922 --> 00:32:11.922
Besides the convicts in lock-up,
is there anyone else there?

00:32:12.047 --> 00:32:14.588
Four students
on a drunken diving charge, sir.

00:32:14.713 --> 00:32:16.297
Alert the other stations.

00:32:16.422 --> 00:32:18.880
Bring all constables to where you're at.
I'm on my way!

00:32:19.005 --> 00:32:20.880
Listen carefully.

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:24.130
Have the constables
shut every door in our station. Got it?

00:32:24.255 --> 00:32:26.880
I understand.
But why are we doing this, sir?

00:32:27.005 --> 00:32:29.797
Stop asking questions
and do what I say. Quick!

00:32:29.922 --> 00:32:31.130
Alert everyone, alright?

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.755
Hoist them in!

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:41.963
I said 'hoist', not 'drop'!

00:32:42.088 --> 00:32:43.963
My arm got stuck!

00:32:44.088 --> 00:32:46.630
Hold this!
-Quit talking! Now lift! Hurry!

00:32:47.672 --> 00:32:49.255
Lift them up!

00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:51.838
Samayapuram police station?

00:32:51.963 --> 00:32:54.130
I'm calling from
the Commissioner's office.

00:32:54.255 --> 00:32:56.005
Inspector there?
-Mr. Murali there?

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.797
He's not here.
-S.I. there?

00:32:57.922 --> 00:33:00.213
He left a while back.
-No officials at the station.

00:33:00.338 --> 00:33:02.297
Give me his mobile number.
-98...

00:33:02.422 --> 00:33:03.963
He's not reachable on his cell.

00:33:04.088 --> 00:33:06.922
Got a message saying 'I.G. Guesthouse'.
-Is that what he said?

00:33:07.047 --> 00:33:08.422
Don't know anything else.

00:33:08.547 --> 00:33:12.255
How many of you are there?
-Just me and another police constable.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.797
If he comes, tell him to call back.
-Will do.

00:33:14.922 --> 00:33:17.297
Ask them why they're hauling
so many people, uncle!

00:33:17.422 --> 00:33:18.668
You just keep loading them in!

00:33:19.088 --> 00:33:21.213
Poor chaps!
-Will you carry vessels on your head?

00:33:21.338 --> 00:33:22.914
At least you tell him, aunty!

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.047
Do whatever you want!
-Listen. Now, we're here.

00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:28.338
This is where we must go.
About 80 kilometers.

00:33:28.463 --> 00:33:30.088
Can't take the Poondi Highway.

00:33:30.213 --> 00:33:33.626
Take a shortcut to Thavakudi
and drop them off at the hospital.

00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:35.880
Then, to the Commissioner's office.
-Know the route?

00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:38.016
Tell me as we go along.
-We need the map.

00:33:39.088 --> 00:33:41.297
All done!
-Any locals here?

00:33:41.422 --> 00:33:43.047
Any other route
to Pazhani?

00:33:43.172 --> 00:33:46.380
There's no route I don't know.
Even Google Maps doesn't know them!

00:33:46.505 --> 00:33:49.583
There's a roundabout shortcut. That fine?
-Know the route?

00:33:49.608 --> 00:33:52.197
From Madhavaram into Devancheri,
Ayampettai, Thittakudi...

00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:54.231
Can a truck go through?
-"Can it go through"?

00:33:54.356 --> 00:33:56.564
Only my truck goes there!
Two checkposts en route.

00:33:56.689 --> 00:33:58.356
If you pay off your guys there...

00:33:58.829 --> 00:34:00.147
They'll let us through.

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:01.622
Bring him, too.
-What?

00:34:01.649 --> 00:34:03.189
Can't drive without directions.

00:34:03.814 --> 00:34:05.939
Hey! Get inside the truck.
-Sir?

00:34:06.064 --> 00:34:07.189
Come!
-What the hell, sir?

00:34:07.314 --> 00:34:08.314
Come!
-Why must I?

00:34:08.439 --> 00:34:09.689
Look at this, uncle!

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.689
You hauled these guys
without my consent!

00:34:11.814 --> 00:34:15.814
If you coolly take my truck,
how do we all go home with our stuff?

00:34:15.939 --> 00:34:17.397
Pay me first, sir!
-Hey!

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:19.064
Think I'm asking for permission?

00:34:19.189 --> 00:34:21.891
40 cops are unconscious!
What did you put in the food?

00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:23.476
I'll arrest you both!

00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:24.893
You can't do business!

00:34:25.018 --> 00:34:26.435
Now get in!
-No, sir...

00:34:29.768 --> 00:34:33.810
That guy casually had ton of biryani
and sits hale and hearty in there, sir!

00:34:33.935 --> 00:34:35.810
How come he alone is fine?

00:34:35.935 --> 00:34:38.630
Do you know how famous Kamatchi Biryani
is in Tiruchy, sir?

00:34:40.571 --> 00:34:43.661
Yes, dear. Only if you go,
will our truck be safe.

00:34:43.696 --> 00:34:44.868
Get lost!

00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:55.321
Let's go.

00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:09.071
I called every station.
They told us exactly what they told you!

00:35:09.196 --> 00:35:11.612
No officials in any station.
Just constables.

00:35:12.654 --> 00:35:15.154
We'll shut all the doors, sir.

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.487
Four of us are here.
We'll manage, sir!

00:35:17.612 --> 00:35:20.987
And if we shut the doors?
Don't know how many of them are coming.

00:35:21.112 --> 00:35:23.196
How many people can we fight
with just batons?

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.571
Sir...

00:35:24.696 --> 00:35:27.487
They asked only us to handle it.
That's why I'm worried.

00:35:27.612 --> 00:35:29.362
So we're the sacrificial lambs?

00:35:29.487 --> 00:35:31.237
I got only five more months of work left.

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:34.029
Don't want to get banged up
and be crippled in my last days!

00:35:34.154 --> 00:35:37.237
That's not it. If there's an inquiry,
we'll be the ones questioned.

00:35:37.362 --> 00:35:40.029
Who said so?
They'll start from the higher-ups.

00:35:40.704 --> 00:35:41.954
Let them deal with it!

00:35:42.654 --> 00:35:43.987
Have you all forgotten?

00:35:44.112 --> 00:35:47.821
When three cops at the Kajarpet station
died during night duty...

00:35:47.946 --> 00:35:50.446
...no higher officials answered the phone
then, too!

00:35:50.571 --> 00:35:52.779
Let's focus on leaving here alive.

00:35:52.904 --> 00:35:54.696
Whatever it is, let the night pass.

00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:57.279
That girl and four boys
are in there, sir.

00:35:57.404 --> 00:35:59.029
Shall we let them go?

00:35:59.154 --> 00:36:02.987
Hey! If you go say something,
you might be busted in the inquiry!

00:36:03.112 --> 00:36:05.154
What is fated to happen will happen.
Come!

00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:29.946
Take this left.

00:36:31.446 --> 00:36:33.636
No, wait!
The next left!

00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:46.430
No... think it was the previous left.

00:36:50.154 --> 00:36:51.196
Hey, kiddo...

00:36:51.321 --> 00:36:54.154
Do you hink this is a moped
where one can turn as they please?

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:56.654
Can't you direct me properly?
-I can only tell like this!

00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:58.237
Take it or find the way yourself!

00:36:58.362 --> 00:36:59.946
He's scolding me, sir!

00:37:00.071 --> 00:37:01.987
This'll confuse me
and I'll forget the route!

00:37:02.112 --> 00:37:03.946
Like you pay me for this!

00:37:04.071 --> 00:37:05.987
Threaten me
as if you pay my salary!

00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:08.404
I pay salaries to many people
every month, you know!

00:37:08.529 --> 00:37:10.226
Tell him to drive quietly, sir!

00:37:30.654 --> 00:37:31.793
Pandi?
-Sir?

00:37:31.818 --> 00:37:33.946
If our guys get there,
point those men out.

00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:35.154
They'll handle...
-No!

00:37:35.279 --> 00:37:39.112
Some random guy picked up all the cops
and is driving them somewhere in a truck!

00:37:39.237 --> 00:37:40.571
Going where?
-I don't know!

00:37:40.696 --> 00:37:43.071
You were there, sir?
Couldn't you do anything?

00:37:43.196 --> 00:37:45.362
I can't do anything, sir!
Bejoy's here, too!

00:37:45.487 --> 00:37:46.487
Okay, hang up.

00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:48.696
I'll call in five minutes
and tell you what to do.

00:37:48.821 --> 00:37:49.821
Alright, sir.

00:37:57.487 --> 00:37:58.487
Hold on.

00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:05.034
No one's around, buddy.
That phone's been ringing for a while.

00:38:10.259 --> 00:38:11.633
They've all left.

00:38:14.675 --> 00:38:16.592
Shall we all just escape, bro?

00:38:16.717 --> 00:38:18.217
Hey!
-Just sit quietly!

00:38:18.342 --> 00:38:20.800
Buzz off!
Incessantly bothering me...

00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:22.300
Hey!
-Tell me!

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.634
Where are you going?

00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:25.009
Tell him to be quiet, Chittu!

00:38:25.134 --> 00:38:27.300
They took us along, Tamizh!
-Be silent!

00:38:27.425 --> 00:38:29.275
Why drink again?
-Shall we booze?

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.509
The Inspector'll come soon...
-Quiet!

00:38:31.634 --> 00:38:32.759
Don't make trouble!

00:38:32.884 --> 00:38:35.079
Blue shirt!
Do you hear me?

00:38:35.977 --> 00:38:37.173
No cops around?

00:38:38.594 --> 00:38:40.634
Yes, there's no one here.

00:38:40.759 --> 00:38:42.938
Just come up for a minute!

00:38:43.634 --> 00:38:44.967
I won't do anything.

00:38:45.092 --> 00:38:48.175
There's a key over here.
Just get it to us.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.842
Don't go!
-Come!

00:38:49.967 --> 00:38:51.384
Don't go there!
-Please help!

00:38:51.509 --> 00:38:52.967
Don't be scared!
-Hey!

00:38:53.092 --> 00:38:55.550
Just get it to us.
-Don't go!

00:38:55.675 --> 00:38:57.217
Come!
-Where are you going?

00:38:57.342 --> 00:38:58.884
That guy called me from up there.

00:38:59.009 --> 00:39:01.259
You should not go near suspects!
Come!

00:39:01.384 --> 00:39:02.842
Where are the other cops?

00:39:02.967 --> 00:39:04.842
We don't know anything.
They left.

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.384
No one's been here for a while.

00:39:06.509 --> 00:39:08.467
How can they leave
during duty hours?

00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:10.175
Move aside.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.717
Why are you people here?

00:39:15.842 --> 00:39:17.550
We're engineering students...
-Stop!

00:39:17.675 --> 00:39:19.342
We got busted for drunken driving.

00:39:19.388 --> 00:39:22.162
The Inspector has our licenses,
cell phones and college IDs.

00:39:22.217 --> 00:39:24.154
We can't leave until he returns.
-Move.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.800
Hello?
-Alerted the other stations, Muthu?

00:39:32.925 --> 00:39:35.634
Who is this?
-Bejoy speaking! Special Task Force!

00:39:35.759 --> 00:39:37.009
Sir!

00:39:37.134 --> 00:39:38.550
There's no one at the station!

00:39:38.675 --> 00:39:40.592
Head constable was there,
but even he left!

00:39:40.717 --> 00:39:42.675
There are no cops around?
What the hell...

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.050
Who are you?
-I'm Napoleon, sir!

00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:49.717
I got transferred here from Tirunelveli.
Haven't joined duty here yet!

00:39:49.842 --> 00:39:51.134
How old are you?

00:39:51.259 --> 00:39:53.384
I turn 55
in the coming 'Puratasi' month!

00:39:53.509 --> 00:39:55.092
Alright, then.

00:39:55.217 --> 00:39:57.050
Your service has commenced.
Got it?

00:39:57.175 --> 00:39:58.550
I don't get it!

00:39:58.675 --> 00:40:02.634
From now on, your posting
is at the Commissioner's office!

00:40:02.759 --> 00:40:03.962
Got it?
-Yes, sir!

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.217
There's an emergency. On my way there now!
I'll reach in two hours!

00:40:07.342 --> 00:40:10.009
Until then,
no one gets into the Commissioner's office!

00:40:10.134 --> 00:40:11.925
Lock all the doors and windows!
-Got it!

00:40:12.029 --> 00:40:14.592
Shut all the gates right away! Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

00:40:43.884 --> 00:40:46.759
Eyes on the road. Next right turn.
I'm not sure about that, too.

00:40:55.009 --> 00:40:58.384
Mustn't I give directions all night?
Tonight, what I say is the route. Go!

00:41:00.342 --> 00:41:01.342
Hey!

00:41:02.217 --> 00:41:04.550
Know what that man will do to you...

00:41:04.675 --> 00:41:07.675
...if I say I'm feeling giddy
after eating the biryani you made?

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.300
Will you tell the route properly, now?
-Yes, bro.

00:41:16.509 --> 00:41:17.884
This right.
Correct route.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.509
Who do I speak to?

00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:26.842
I'll give you the number
of a guy named Tips.

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:29.584
Tell him the route.
-I'll call him right away!

00:41:33.967 --> 00:41:37.050
Cleared the stuff from the upper level!
-Have them clear out soon!

00:41:38.759 --> 00:41:39.759
Hello?
-Tips?

00:41:39.884 --> 00:41:41.967
I'm the guy Mr. Stephen told you about.
-Go on.

00:41:42.092 --> 00:41:45.384
The truck's going by Madhavaram.
Don't know where it's headed.

00:41:45.509 --> 00:41:47.800
They're taking a right
into Devancheri!

00:41:47.925 --> 00:41:49.509
Keep giving me the directions.

00:41:49.634 --> 00:41:51.675
I'll handle it.
-Will do!

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.342
Hey!
The truck is not at the I.G.'s guesthouse.

00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:58.175
They're carrying all of them
and going via Madhavaram.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.175
They'll have to cross the hill.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.967
Split up into teams and go.

00:42:02.092 --> 00:42:04.550
If they escape from any one of you,
the other will get them!

00:42:19.092 --> 00:42:22.050
He's not even a cop, bro!
I think he's just a watchman!

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.259
Sir!
-What happened, Napoleon?

00:42:29.384 --> 00:42:31.217
All the doors are shut, sir!

00:42:31.342 --> 00:42:34.884
Including the main door.
But they need reinforcement from inside!

00:42:35.009 --> 00:42:36.509
Then do it!
I'm on my way there!

00:42:36.634 --> 00:42:37.967
Can't do it on my own, sir.

00:42:38.092 --> 00:42:40.925
Sir!
Why did you lock all the doors, sir?

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.550
First, let us go!
-Wait!

00:42:42.675 --> 00:42:45.592
Who's that?
-The girl who came with the college kids.

00:42:45.717 --> 00:42:47.675
Shall I let them go?
-Don't do that.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.634
No one leaves until I get there.
Take all their phones.

00:42:50.759 --> 00:42:52.300
Alright, sir.
Give me that phone.

00:42:52.425 --> 00:42:55.509
Why, sir?
-I'll return it soon! Just give it.

00:42:56.884 --> 00:42:59.675
Have those kids help you lock up. Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.384
Each of you give me a hand.

00:43:01.509 --> 00:43:03.800
Use these benches and chairs
to block the doors!

00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:06.384
Come along!
-Why should we do all this, sir?

00:43:06.509 --> 00:43:08.701
You took our phones
and won't let us go!

00:43:08.726 --> 00:43:11.592
Return it! I need to call the Inspector!
-Hold on! I'll return it!

00:43:11.717 --> 00:43:13.884
We can only help
if you tell us what's going on!

00:43:14.009 --> 00:43:16.467
I myself don't know!
Let the higher official arrive!

00:43:16.592 --> 00:43:17.592
He'll explain!

00:43:17.717 --> 00:43:21.240
We'll help out. Just don't charge
any of us for drunken driving!

00:43:21.342 --> 00:43:22.717
What?
-I'll handle it.

00:43:22.842 --> 00:43:25.009
Forget that, sir!
They drunk and drove.

00:43:25.134 --> 00:43:26.842
I just accompanied them!
-Is that so?

00:43:26.967 --> 00:43:29.092
Sir! Don't charge us...
-Shut up!

00:43:29.217 --> 00:43:30.550
I'll give you an earful!

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:33.009
He's struggling so much by himself!
Got no sense?

00:43:33.967 --> 00:43:36.342
I'll stay until the other cops come!
Leave if you wish!

00:43:36.467 --> 00:43:38.175
I'll come help, sir!
-Come along!

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.557
Give me a hand with that bench.

00:43:42.134 --> 00:43:43.342
Push harder!

00:43:46.217 --> 00:43:47.168
Come!

00:43:48.925 --> 00:43:50.134
Keep pushing!

00:44:03.967 --> 00:44:05.467
Crossing Vannadu!
Yes!

00:44:06.792 --> 00:44:08.384
Confirmed?
-Indeed!

00:44:08.509 --> 00:44:10.050
Moongilthottam!
I saw the board!

00:44:11.717 --> 00:44:14.884
The guys are coming.
Just point out those five cops!

00:44:14.977 --> 00:44:16.821
Alright.
-They'll handle the rest.

00:44:27.092 --> 00:44:28.134
Help lift this!

00:44:34.425 --> 00:44:36.050
There's a door there.
-Yes, sir.

00:44:36.717 --> 00:44:37.717
Over there!

00:44:40.175 --> 00:44:41.759
Haul it in!
-Lift it carefully!

00:44:41.884 --> 00:44:43.550
Hey!
-What is it?

00:44:43.675 --> 00:44:45.384
The booze, you idiot!
-Alright, jerk!

00:44:45.509 --> 00:44:46.509
Go!

00:45:11.425 --> 00:45:12.425
All ready over there?

00:45:13.467 --> 00:45:15.259
Yes, Tips.
-The truck's on the way.

00:45:15.384 --> 00:45:18.467
Hack up those five right there
and bring me their heads!

00:45:18.592 --> 00:45:20.384
Got it?
-I'll call you once it's done.

00:45:24.425 --> 00:45:25.425
Hey!

00:45:26.425 --> 00:45:29.891
What is that noise?
-Is this the time to play with the alarm?

00:45:30.884 --> 00:45:33.384
Turn it off, Amudha!
-That damn thing keeps making noise!

00:45:33.509 --> 00:45:34.967
What do you want now?

00:45:35.092 --> 00:45:37.259
Want to know who's visiting you
in the morning?

00:45:38.884 --> 00:45:39.884
The number register.

00:45:44.009 --> 00:45:46.967
Radio's down, too. How do we go
so far without listening to music?

00:45:47.884 --> 00:45:49.842
Do you have a phone, bro?

00:45:49.967 --> 00:45:52.009
How would you have one?

00:45:52.134 --> 00:45:54.759
Just got released today, right?
Like a new movie!

00:45:54.884 --> 00:45:56.467
How many years were you in jail?

00:45:57.842 --> 00:45:59.300
Ten years.
-Wow!

00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:02.759
2009!

00:46:02.884 --> 00:46:04.717
I was in eighth grade back then!

00:46:04.842 --> 00:46:07.175
Since you went to prison,
quite a lot has changed!

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.300
They said they'll change the nation.
But no major changes yet.

00:46:10.425 --> 00:46:12.675
We only voted once,
but...

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.967
If you're not on WhatsApp,
you're not alive!

00:46:15.092 --> 00:46:17.384
Ajith and Rajnikanth's films
released on the same day!

00:46:17.509 --> 00:46:20.050
Nowadays,
films run only if they have a good story!

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.009
Hell, now we save the cops
who've been saving us so far!

00:46:25.134 --> 00:46:26.884
Many such things have changed!

00:46:27.009 --> 00:46:30.978
Poor guy!
Seem like a fish out of water, right?

00:46:31.345 --> 00:46:33.842
Keep going.
You'll prefer prison to this!

00:46:36.592 --> 00:46:37.842
Hey!

00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:39.717
You think prison is in the planet Mars?

00:46:40.717 --> 00:46:42.592
Only a wall separates us!

00:46:44.009 --> 00:46:46.425
There's a folder with Yesudas songs
in it. Play them.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.467
Figured when I saw the ash
on your forehead!

00:46:49.634 --> 00:46:52.675
Used whatever was available
and blocked all the doors, sir!

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.550
No one can break in easily!

00:46:54.675 --> 00:46:57.092
Unlike what you said,
no one's come about, sir.

00:46:57.217 --> 00:46:58.925
Alright.
Listen up.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.467
Turn off all the lights.
-Okay.

00:47:00.592 --> 00:47:01.967
I'm on my way.
-Yes, sir.

00:47:02.092 --> 00:47:04.592
Don't be scared, alright?
-Yes, sir. Please come!

00:47:06.675 --> 00:47:08.888
Hurry up!
-Sir!

00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:12.717
No diesel left.
Don't know when the vehicle will stop.

00:47:12.842 --> 00:47:14.300
I'll tell you.
Now drive!

00:47:14.425 --> 00:47:16.134
How will the vehicle go
if you say so?

00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:17.842
(A Yesudas song plays on the phone)

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.259
My dad took care of the catering company.

00:47:39.384 --> 00:47:42.675
After he died,
I run the business along with my uncle.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.592
Others use sub-standard rice
for biryani.

00:47:45.717 --> 00:47:48.550
We use the best kind!
Our brand stands for quality!

00:47:49.384 --> 00:47:50.800
How was the biryani?

00:47:50.925 --> 00:47:53.009
Right! You would've had slop
for years!

00:47:53.134 --> 00:47:55.509
Even plain rice would seem like biryani
to you, yes?

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.550
A call's coming in for you!

00:48:01.509 --> 00:48:03.092
I have no one to call me.

00:48:05.425 --> 00:48:07.467
No one's picking up.

00:48:07.592 --> 00:48:09.092
Try calling again.

00:48:09.217 --> 00:48:11.750
Do it quickly. Ma'am might come!
I'll be in trouble!

00:48:11.775 --> 00:48:13.425
Just once more, sir!
-Okay, do it.

00:48:27.134 --> 00:48:29.592
Another call from the same number,
bro!

00:48:37.884 --> 00:48:39.259
Hello?
-Hello?

00:48:39.384 --> 00:48:40.717
This is Amudha speaking.

00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:43.925
Are you coming to visit me tomorrow?

00:48:45.337 --> 00:48:46.618
How are we related?

00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:33.631
Damn it!
He got away!

00:49:35.259 --> 00:49:36.259
Faster!

00:49:36.384 --> 00:49:37.800
Stop for nothing!
Drive fast!

00:49:38.766 --> 00:49:41.415
Hello?
Hello?

00:49:44.188 --> 00:49:45.842
He must not cross Tittivanam!

00:49:45.905 --> 00:49:47.134
Is the stuff inside?
-Yes!

00:49:47.259 --> 00:49:48.800
He mustn't cross the forest!
-Hurry!

00:49:48.925 --> 00:49:50.342
Go! Go! Go!

00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:07.342
Can you hear me?
Hello?

00:50:14.884 --> 00:50:17.092
Two vehicles are behind us! Drive faster!
-Sir!

00:50:17.217 --> 00:50:19.092
Who are these guys?
What's going on?

00:50:19.217 --> 00:50:20.967
Stop asking questions
and drive fast!

00:50:21.092 --> 00:50:22.675
The vehicle can only go this fast!

00:50:23.634 --> 00:50:24.675
Get closer!

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.967
Go left!
-Get closer!

00:50:27.842 --> 00:50:28.842
Drive faster!

00:50:32.259 --> 00:50:33.967
He's not saying anything.

00:50:34.555 --> 00:50:36.050
Alright, give it to me.

00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:41.134
All the glass is shattered, sir!

00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:43.134
How do I explain this back home?

00:50:44.342 --> 00:50:46.175
Keep going!
Take a right!

00:50:51.967 --> 00:50:54.300
Don't let them overtake you! Go right!
-He's going!

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.217
Take the rod
and break open that lock!

00:51:00.342 --> 00:51:02.092
I'll handle it!
Get the rod!

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:12.425
Don't step on it like it's dung!
Faster!

00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:15.717
They're close!
Drive faster!

00:51:16.425 --> 00:51:18.092
Step on it!
-Break the lock!

00:51:18.217 --> 00:51:20.634
They're overtaking us!
Take a left!

00:51:27.842 --> 00:51:29.050
Get even closer!

00:51:29.175 --> 00:51:31.717
Look that side!
-Step on it!

00:51:44.467 --> 00:51:46.092
They've opened the back door, sir!

00:51:49.366 --> 00:51:51.592
Head back!
Looks like the I.G. might fall!

00:51:51.717 --> 00:51:54.092
Get him back in! Hurry!
-You go, sir!

00:51:54.217 --> 00:51:56.800
Why are you sending a kid? If he gets hurt?
I brought him along!

00:51:56.925 --> 00:51:58.734
Look at my hand! How do I go?

00:51:58.804 --> 00:52:00.226
You go!
-Sir!

00:52:00.297 --> 00:52:01.281
Stay here!

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:04.797
Do you know who that is?
The Inspector General!

00:52:04.898 --> 00:52:07.717
Does that make him a big shot?
He's just fated for a short life!

00:52:07.742 --> 00:52:09.034
You stay here!
-Listen up!

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:12.300
If anything happens to him,
you won't go home alive! Now head back!

00:52:13.092 --> 00:52:14.092
Go quickly!

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.050
Maintain the same distance!

00:52:29.175 --> 00:52:30.842
Attach the hook onto the truck!

00:52:30.967 --> 00:52:32.675
Toss out anyone you find!

00:52:39.425 --> 00:52:41.175
Throw it at them!
-Do it!

00:52:43.217 --> 00:52:45.050
Toss it right at the driver!

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.175
Faster!

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.925
Get me that hook!
-Here!

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.384
Get closer!

00:52:55.509 --> 00:52:57.384
Driver faster!
-Step on it!

00:52:57.509 --> 00:52:58.509
Get closer!

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.550
Hey! The guys are here!
Come on!

00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:09.800
Hurry up!
-Here you go!

00:53:09.925 --> 00:53:11.675
Light it up!
Quickly!

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.217
Light it up!

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.842
Give it to me!
-Come up front!

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.092
Toss that petrol bomb!

00:53:20.217 --> 00:53:21.467
Give it to me!

00:53:28.884 --> 00:53:30.675
Climb on!
Climb on top of it!

00:53:34.759 --> 00:53:36.134
Throw it at the driver's face!

00:53:38.342 --> 00:53:39.884
Give it!
-Toss it at his face!

00:53:40.399 --> 00:53:41.940
-Bro!

00:54:08.092 --> 00:54:09.717
Step on it!
Hurry!

00:54:09.842 --> 00:54:11.300
The clutch is broken, jackass!

00:54:11.425 --> 00:54:12.759
It can't move any further!

00:54:14.342 --> 00:54:15.509
Hold the steering wheel!

00:54:26.884 --> 00:54:28.134
Go up front!
I'll handle it!

00:54:41.467 --> 00:54:43.134
The fuel's leaking!
Stop it!

00:55:05.509 --> 00:55:06.675
Jump out!

00:55:07.967 --> 00:55:10.509
Get out, guys!

00:55:22.307 --> 00:55:23.509
I hear a motorbike, sir.

00:55:59.117 --> 00:56:00.515
Hello?
-Hello!

00:56:01.398 --> 00:56:03.189
A girl spoke to me.

00:56:04.476 --> 00:56:06.231
Can I talk to her, sir?

00:56:06.356 --> 00:56:07.356
Who are you?

00:56:09.564 --> 00:56:10.564
I am...

00:56:11.603 --> 00:56:12.981
I am her father, sir.

00:56:13.106 --> 00:56:16.641
You abandoned her at this ashram
and shamelessly say you're her father?

00:56:18.439 --> 00:56:20.148
All my bad luck, sir.

00:56:20.273 --> 00:56:22.939
You know how many times
Amudha tried calling you?

00:56:23.064 --> 00:56:25.189
You didn't pick up at all.

00:56:25.291 --> 00:56:28.064
Poor girl walked away,
hanging her head.

00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:32.064
Cell phone signal was down
as I was going through the forest.

00:56:33.231 --> 00:56:36.148
The line got cut off
before I could say a word.

00:56:36.273 --> 00:56:38.273
Can you please call that child, sir?

00:56:38.398 --> 00:56:39.939
It's pretty hard, my man.

00:56:40.064 --> 00:56:43.023
Think your child
is studying in a convent school?

00:56:43.148 --> 00:56:45.648
This is an orphange.

00:56:45.714 --> 00:56:49.189
All the 150 girls here
stay in one room.

00:56:49.314 --> 00:56:53.731
They're sleeping all over the place
while being bitten by mosquitoes!

00:56:54.356 --> 00:56:55.356
I understand, sir.

00:56:56.731 --> 00:56:59.564
I've never seen my child's face
since she was born.

00:57:01.273 --> 00:57:03.023
I'll pay you when I come in the morning.

00:57:03.148 --> 00:57:05.116
What?
You'll pay me?

00:57:05.913 --> 00:57:09.564
Expect me to take a bribe to let a father
and child speak for the first time...

00:57:09.689 --> 00:57:11.023
...and die in shame for that?

00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:12.856
I said I can't...

00:57:12.981 --> 00:57:16.481
I said I can't go in right now.
Try to understand.

00:57:16.606 --> 00:57:17.606
Please forgive me.

00:57:19.398 --> 00:57:21.731
When I heard my child's voice
for the first time...

00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:24.481
...I just got floored.

00:57:24.606 --> 00:57:26.490
That's why I spoke that way.
Somehow...

00:57:26.606 --> 00:57:29.773
I recall seeing Amudha's photo
on the notice board once.

00:57:29.898 --> 00:57:31.273
If it's there,
I'll send it.

00:57:31.398 --> 00:57:33.314
Do you have WhatsApp?
-Yes.

00:57:33.439 --> 00:57:34.564
Bless you, sir.

00:57:34.689 --> 00:57:36.273
First let me check if it's there.

00:57:38.856 --> 00:57:41.273
If you just go straight,
we'll reach Tittivanam.

00:57:41.398 --> 00:57:42.648
Just twelve kilometers.

00:57:42.773 --> 00:57:45.564
Hard to travel by this vehicle.
All forest area!

00:57:45.689 --> 00:57:47.648
No proper lights or roads.

00:57:49.148 --> 00:57:50.356
Start up the vehicle.

00:57:51.731 --> 00:57:52.731
I can't do it, sir.

00:57:54.106 --> 00:57:56.273
You asked me to drop you off
and go about my way.

00:57:56.379 --> 00:57:59.356
Who the hell are those guys?
They would've killed us!

00:57:59.481 --> 00:58:01.148
I'll explain everything.
Now come!

00:58:01.273 --> 00:58:02.314
I won't do it, sir!

00:58:02.439 --> 00:58:03.523
Tell me what's going on!

00:58:04.523 --> 00:58:06.064
You all will booze
and pass out!

00:58:06.189 --> 00:58:07.439
Should we suffer for it?

00:58:07.564 --> 00:58:09.148
What the hell was that, sir?

00:58:09.273 --> 00:58:10.856
Think you cops can do anything?

00:58:10.981 --> 00:58:12.606
What about the truck, sir?

00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:15.231
Your truck will be restored
to the way it was! Get in!

00:58:15.356 --> 00:58:18.189
The truck can be fixed.
What if he had died?

00:58:18.314 --> 00:58:20.106
I'm going!
I'll walk the rest of the way!

00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:23.189
Find the route yourself!
Inviting me for my own death, huh?

00:58:23.314 --> 00:58:26.356
They're not the drunken rogues
that you think they are!

00:58:26.481 --> 00:58:29.064
They're cops who've been on the job
for 10-15 years!

00:58:29.189 --> 00:58:31.648
They've been intentionally drugged!
Come!

00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:37.398
You know what will happen
if they reclaim these drugs?

00:58:37.523 --> 00:58:38.523
You won't understand!

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:40.564
Start the truck
if you want to see your child!

00:58:46.648 --> 00:58:48.189
Wait!
Did you drink?

00:58:48.314 --> 00:58:51.648
Oh, so it's fine for them to drink,
but it's not okay if I do?

00:58:51.711 --> 00:58:54.158
Stand before a stove all day!
You'll see how it ache!

00:58:58.283 --> 00:58:59.492
They've left, bro.

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:12.391
Pull over here, bro!

00:59:15.703 --> 00:59:17.062
What is it?
Isn't this the route?

00:59:17.297 --> 00:59:19.320
Yes. But don't know if we go left or right.
-Hello

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:21.589
I've sent the photo. See it.
-Alright, sir.

00:59:22.396 --> 00:59:23.797
Yes, Tips!

00:59:23.922 --> 00:59:25.922
Check post number ten!
-Have you crossed it?

00:59:26.047 --> 00:59:27.797
No!
We haven't turned back!

00:59:29.047 --> 00:59:30.881
Take the left, bro.
We'll handle it.

00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:40.006
He turned left
at the check post!

01:00:02.508 --> 01:00:03.964
I received a photo.

01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:05.860
This thing's just spinning.
Check it.

01:00:06.172 --> 01:00:08.756
Ah! If there's the letter 'E',
the image won't download.

01:00:08.851 --> 01:00:11.131
If you had 3G or 4G,
there'd be instant download!

01:00:11.256 --> 01:00:14.422
My phone is with my uncle.
Else, I would've shown it to you.

01:00:14.547 --> 01:00:16.422
Shall I ask the cop for internet, bro?

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:18.400
Hey!
It appears no one is inside.

01:00:18.425 --> 01:00:20.339
Go stand by the vehicle.
-Okay.

01:00:28.908 --> 01:00:30.631
To me, all crows are black, bro!

01:00:30.756 --> 01:00:32.339
But don't they know their parents?

01:00:32.464 --> 01:00:35.297
Just go and watch
how your daughter runs right to you, bro!

01:00:35.422 --> 01:00:36.422
What do you say, sir?

01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:39.572
Hey! The road's empty, right?
Step on it!

01:00:46.922 --> 01:00:50.256
At the rate it's spinning, it'll blow wind
but won't download the photo!

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.547
This phone is crap!

01:00:52.672 --> 01:00:54.964
Heard of Oppo or Vivo phones?

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:57.631
That Vivo V5 model?
Should've bought one of those!

01:01:02.297 --> 01:01:03.506
Look over there, bro!

01:01:05.714 --> 01:01:07.047
Don't stop!
Step on it!

01:01:07.172 --> 01:01:08.422
Keep going!

01:01:08.547 --> 01:01:09.547
Drive fast!

01:01:10.297 --> 01:01:11.922
Faster!
Don't stop!

01:01:28.214 --> 01:01:30.131
Reverse!
Back up!

01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:32.937
Faster!
-Go fast, bro!

01:02:12.089 --> 01:02:13.589
A vehicle's coming from behind!

01:02:41.172 --> 01:02:43.006
What happened?
-The lights are out.

01:02:43.131 --> 01:02:45.589
Don't know if it's safe to go in.
What do we do?

01:02:46.506 --> 01:02:47.506
Go break the door.

01:02:48.881 --> 01:02:49.881
See if you have a rod.

01:02:51.631 --> 01:02:54.547
They've got knives and sticks, bro!
Do something!

01:02:54.672 --> 01:02:56.339
See if you can turn the truck around!

01:02:56.464 --> 01:02:59.006
All forest area around us, sir!
-Run over them and go!

01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:01.047
I can't run them over
and go back to prison.

01:03:01.172 --> 01:03:03.256
Just run them down!
I'll handle the fallout!

01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:07.714
Hey!

01:03:07.839 --> 01:03:09.381
I cornered the truck!

01:03:09.506 --> 01:03:11.589
Those five heads are mine!

01:03:11.714 --> 01:03:13.464
Just go back the way you came!

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:14.922
How's that, now?

01:03:15.047 --> 01:03:18.631
I set up the bamboo to block the truck
and forced it to change routes!

01:03:18.756 --> 01:03:20.797
You'll take the five heads!

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.922
Am I a simpleton?

01:03:23.047 --> 01:03:26.881
So I can tie the nuptial thread
but you get to enjoy the wedding night?

01:03:27.006 --> 01:03:28.006
Why not?

01:03:28.131 --> 01:03:30.631
If you come late,
I'd be the one to do it!

01:03:30.756 --> 01:03:32.547
I'm the one that trapped them!

01:03:32.672 --> 01:03:35.256
You came from the back!
I stand up front!

01:03:35.381 --> 01:03:37.547
Doesn't take much
to attack a trapped rat!

01:03:37.672 --> 01:03:39.006
Go back quietly!

01:03:39.131 --> 01:03:40.672
Let's fight it out!

01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:42.714
Whoever wins
gets to take the heads!

01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:45.589
What the hell are you thinking?
Drive!

01:03:46.464 --> 01:03:48.047
How long have you been in business?

01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:49.422
What is it, bro?
-What?

01:03:49.547 --> 01:03:52.214
Didn't have the guts to finish the job
once you had him!

01:03:52.339 --> 01:03:55.526
Now you raise your voice here, you prick?
Can you see?

01:03:55.739 --> 01:03:58.381
You said you'd ensure
I'd never see my daughter again.

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.339
I had no other options.

01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:03.547
I'll bury them and go about my way!
-Do it now.

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:05.922
I'm honestly not that type of man!

01:04:06.047 --> 01:04:08.464
If I didn't say so,
you wouldn't have agreed to drive!

01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:10.562
All those guys in the back
have families!

01:04:10.726 --> 01:04:12.089
Go!
-Why, sir?

01:04:12.214 --> 01:04:13.547
No one will leave here alive!

01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:15.464
Don't we people have families, too?

01:04:16.339 --> 01:04:17.839
(A caller tune plays)

01:04:23.256 --> 01:04:24.922
Mr. Ranga!
This is Saga's brother!

01:04:25.047 --> 01:04:26.631
We've chased them this far!

01:04:26.756 --> 01:04:29.089
Let's make a deal!
They burned five of our guys!

01:04:30.089 --> 01:04:33.297
It's Saga's brother. He wants to make
a deal. Some of their men were burned.

01:04:33.422 --> 01:04:34.631
What deal?
-Alright, sir.

01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:37.256
I'll forget everything you said.

01:04:38.078 --> 01:04:40.714
I'll drop you off
without a single scratch.

01:04:41.922 --> 01:04:43.047
What will you give me?

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:46.006
I'll give you anything!
No time to bargain! Start the vehicle!

01:04:46.131 --> 01:04:48.506
This is my time, sir.
-Alright. How much do you want?

01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:50.631
Who wants your money?
-Then what do you want?

01:04:54.756 --> 01:04:56.631
A room for my daughter.

01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:00.297
A fan just for her.

01:05:02.756 --> 01:05:03.922
A bed.

01:05:06.172 --> 01:05:07.589
A good school for her to study.

01:05:11.672 --> 01:05:12.672
Can you do this?

01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:14.589
Educating your child
is no big issue!

01:05:14.714 --> 01:05:16.464
If they know you saved the I.G...
-Sir!

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:19.714
Will you make this happen?
-I will!

01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:20.839
Promise me.

01:05:24.839 --> 01:05:26.006
Let's make a deal!

01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:29.756
You take three heads!
Leave two for me!

01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:32.089
I also did the work, right?

01:05:33.381 --> 01:05:34.964
I promise to do it!
Now step on it!

01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:37.881
You may have done the work...
-You promise with the left hand?

01:05:39.216 --> 01:05:40.881
What if you forget
in the morning?

01:05:41.006 --> 01:05:42.797
Now you intrude
and negotitate?

01:05:42.922 --> 01:05:45.006
Losers get no deals!
-Listen up!

01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:48.756
This is my daughter. I'll see to it
your daughter studies in her school!

01:05:48.881 --> 01:05:50.506
I swear upon my daughter.

01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:51.631
Please drive!

01:05:53.006 --> 01:05:54.006
Drive!

01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:57.339
Let's pretend to agree.
Only four of them are here, right?

01:05:57.464 --> 01:05:58.983
We'll kill all of them.

01:05:59.092 --> 01:06:00.589
But one thing!

01:06:00.714 --> 01:06:02.381
The guy who drove the vehicle?

01:06:02.506 --> 01:06:04.297
The one with handcuffs?

01:06:04.422 --> 01:06:05.964
He's mine!

01:06:06.089 --> 01:06:07.381
Don't touch him!

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.464
Stay there!
I'll call after wrapping this...

01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:12.506
Where are you going?
We're surrounded!

01:06:12.631 --> 01:06:14.047
What are you doing, bro?

01:06:16.422 --> 01:06:18.797
You only know that I've been in prison
for ten years.

01:06:20.172 --> 01:06:22.881
You don't know what I was doing
before I went to jail, right?

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:06.144
Leave him.
They'll take care of him.

01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:07.936
Go bring over those five cops.

01:07:08.936 --> 01:07:09.936
Go, guys.

01:07:29.352 --> 01:07:31.561
Hey!
Step aside.

01:07:32.727 --> 01:07:33.769
Can't you listen...

01:07:55.144 --> 01:07:56.144
Go!

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.186
Go!
Attack him from the back!

01:08:46.852 --> 01:08:47.977
Look here, bro!

01:08:55.727 --> 01:08:56.727
Bro!

01:08:58.519 --> 01:08:59.519
Bro!
Behind you!

01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:53.419
Look here, sir!

01:10:10.018 --> 01:10:11.685
A man's in the back of the truck, bro!

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.835
Until today, no one in my family
has even set foot in a police station!

01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:36.749
Why?
They directly go to the court, huh?

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.685
What do you study?
-Engineering.

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:41.935
EC Engineering.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.435
You study engineering
and loiter drunk like so?

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.060
That's why we loiter drunk, sir!

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.393
Someone's breaking the gate, sir!

01:11:06.768 --> 01:11:09.268
Get down, guys!
-Mani! Give everyone their weapons!

01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:23.060
Listen up!
I don't care who is in there!

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.226
You have five minutes!

01:11:25.976 --> 01:11:29.476
Open the door!
I'll take my stuff and go on my way!

01:11:29.601 --> 01:11:32.060
If I break in and enter,
none of you will remain alive!

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:41.976
There about twenty to thirty people
at the entrance, sir.

01:11:42.101 --> 01:11:43.185
What do I do, sir?

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:45.851
Hold on, Napoleon.
Don't be afraid.

01:11:45.976 --> 01:11:48.101
Where are you, sir?
-I'm on my way!

01:11:48.226 --> 01:11:49.851
I'll call back. Hang up.
-Okay, sir.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:05.310
Sir!

01:12:06.935 --> 01:12:08.393
See if there's another way in.

01:12:08.518 --> 01:12:09.518
Come on, guys!

01:12:12.935 --> 01:12:15.893
Go look that side!
-Who's in there?

01:12:16.018 --> 01:12:19.476
Only one of them had a gun, sir.
Had to bring it with his holster. Here.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.726
Hey!
Light it up.

01:12:25.185 --> 01:12:27.143
How long for the vehicle to be ready?

01:12:27.268 --> 01:12:29.435
The clutch and brake have heated up.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.643
Take about 10-15 minutes
to cool down.

01:12:31.768 --> 01:12:34.518
Can't explain this to my mother.
Please handle this.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:37.185
This truck
is our family's livelihood!

01:12:38.518 --> 01:12:39.601
Napoleon?
-Sir?

01:12:40.393 --> 01:12:44.310
They're breaking everything! What to do?
-Hold on! Don't be scared!

01:12:44.435 --> 01:12:46.351
Listen carefully to what I say.
-Alright.

01:12:46.476 --> 01:12:48.476
Go to the cell at the top floor.

01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:49.768
Move aside.

01:12:49.893 --> 01:12:52.185
They'll be a guy in a blue shirt.
Give him the phone.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:53.601
Alright.
-Wait. No need.

01:12:53.726 --> 01:12:57.060
Ask the college kids
if any of them can make a video call.

01:12:57.185 --> 01:13:00.226
What's going on?
-Can we make a video call on your phone?

01:13:00.351 --> 01:13:02.643
Yes, we can.
-I'll call you from that, sir!

01:13:06.976 --> 01:13:08.143
Who's in there?
Come out!

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.351
Sir?
-Hold it this way and talk, sir.

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.018
Tell me, sir.
-Hey, Blue shirt.

01:13:16.143 --> 01:13:19.101
The one in the corner.
Step up front.

01:13:19.226 --> 01:13:20.643
Can you see me?

01:13:20.768 --> 01:13:22.768
Yes, sir.
-Talk to your guys who are outside.

01:13:23.643 --> 01:13:25.351
The drugs you're after isn't here.

01:13:25.476 --> 01:13:27.143
Tell him I'll let you guys go.

01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:29.393
No harm must come to my people there.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:31.810
Ask him to give me a phone.

01:13:31.935 --> 01:13:33.851
Give him your phone, Napoleon.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:35.393
Give it.
-Here you go.

01:13:39.101 --> 01:13:40.726
Get a Jio SIM once you get back!

01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:43.435
He's making a video call.
You're still looking for a signal!

01:13:44.226 --> 01:13:45.226
Anbu?

01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:46.726
Who is this?
-It's Shankar.

01:13:46.851 --> 01:13:48.643
Where are you?
How did you get this phone?

01:13:48.768 --> 01:13:52.435
The policeman...
he's on the phone right now.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.143
He's making a deal.

01:13:54.268 --> 01:13:55.810
They'll let us go.

01:13:55.935 --> 01:13:58.226
But we must not hurt
the people here.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.685
Is my brother safe?

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.351
Tell me.
Wasn't he with you?

01:14:01.476 --> 01:14:03.393
He's on a video call, Anbu.

01:14:03.518 --> 01:14:05.132
Say it in a way I'll understand!

01:14:07.185 --> 01:14:08.226
The boss...

01:14:08.351 --> 01:14:09.768
The cop...

01:14:10.518 --> 01:14:12.685
I said he's on the line.
-Is he inside?

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:16.976
Yes, Anbu.
-Alright! I won't do anything!

01:14:17.101 --> 01:14:18.351
No one here will come in!

01:14:18.476 --> 01:14:20.149
No harm will come from my side!

01:14:20.259 --> 01:14:22.717
Open the door and you guys come out!
Agree to the deal!

01:14:22.842 --> 01:14:24.509
Agree to the deal!
-Alright, Anbu!

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.800
He accepts the deal.
Open it up.

01:14:28.759 --> 01:14:30.009
Tell everyone to back off.

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:32.342
Open up the cell.
-Yes, sir.

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:34.800
No harm will come to you all.
You may leave safely.

01:14:34.925 --> 01:14:35.925
Alright.

01:14:37.217 --> 01:14:38.217
What are they doing?

01:14:46.425 --> 01:14:48.884
The seven guys who were caught
were low level thugs, sir.

01:14:49.009 --> 01:14:50.550
They'll let us go.

01:14:50.675 --> 01:14:53.259
But we must not hurt
the people here.

01:14:53.384 --> 01:14:54.884
I said he's on the line.

01:14:56.842 --> 01:14:59.675
Yes, Anbu.
He's inside.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.800
Open it up!

01:15:01.842 --> 01:15:03.342
Alright, sir.
Come on.

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:06.800
Truck's ready. Shall we go?
-Hold on!

01:15:08.425 --> 01:15:09.842
Yes, sir?
-Napoleon!

01:15:09.967 --> 01:15:11.550
Opened the cell?
-I'm about to!

01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:14.717
Don't do it. First listen to me.
-What is it, sir?

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.592
Ask the names of those inside!
-Yes, sir.

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:21.717
What's your name?

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.384
Hitler!

01:15:23.509 --> 01:15:24.759
Your name?
-Gopal.

01:15:24.884 --> 01:15:26.259
And you?
-Shankar.

01:15:26.384 --> 01:15:27.384
You?
-Moorthy!

01:15:28.592 --> 01:15:29.592
Who is he?

01:15:29.717 --> 01:15:31.509
Hey!
What's your name?

01:15:31.634 --> 01:15:33.175
What?
Are you hard of hearing?

01:15:35.592 --> 01:15:37.259
What happened?

01:15:37.384 --> 01:15:38.592
My brother's inside.

01:15:38.717 --> 01:15:40.675
They nabbed him
without knowing who he is.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.550
First, let him step out safely.

01:15:42.675 --> 01:15:44.759
Then, we will kill everyone in there!

01:15:45.925 --> 01:15:47.550
Hey!
What's your name?

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:57.509
One of them's not telling me his name,
sir!

01:15:57.634 --> 01:15:58.800
Step back.

01:15:59.675 --> 01:16:00.884
He's Adaikalam.

01:16:01.009 --> 01:16:03.425
If he's out,
he won't spare any of you.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.759
Whatever you do, don't open the door.
Back away!

01:16:08.759 --> 01:16:10.134
Sir!
-Give me the key!

01:16:10.259 --> 01:16:12.175
Ajay!
-I'll chop you up!

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.467
Hurry up!

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.092
Give it!
Give me the key!

01:16:16.217 --> 01:16:17.550
Hello?
Napoleon?

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:20.175
Give me the key!

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.384
Give it!

01:16:26.884 --> 01:16:27.884
Hurry up, guys!

01:16:28.009 --> 01:16:29.800
Hurry! Let's go!
Where's Dilli?

01:16:29.925 --> 01:16:31.634
He's looking for a signal there!
-Come!

01:16:32.329 --> 01:16:33.400
Give me the key!

01:16:34.842 --> 01:16:36.884
Ajay!
-Throw me that key.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.384
Pick up that key!

01:16:40.641 --> 01:16:41.593
Come on!

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.433
Dilli!
Start the vehicle!

01:16:45.558 --> 01:16:47.308
Only forty kilometers to go.
Hurry!

01:16:48.224 --> 01:16:49.558
What happened?
Let's go!

01:16:50.474 --> 01:16:51.474
What is it?

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:54.349
Toss it here!
-Ajay!

01:16:54.474 --> 01:16:57.016
Toss me the key!
-They caught hold of him!

01:16:57.141 --> 01:16:59.141
Throw me the key!
-He might die!

01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:00.683
When I get out, I'll kill you!

01:17:03.058 --> 01:17:04.349
Don't give it to him!

01:17:05.933 --> 01:17:07.266
Shut the doors, guys!

01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:08.724
Shut the doors!

01:17:11.641 --> 01:17:12.641
Charge!

01:17:31.891 --> 01:17:32.891
My child, sir.

01:17:36.433 --> 01:17:37.854
If one has a child...

01:17:39.099 --> 01:17:40.599
...they never die, right?

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.681
She has my eyes.

01:17:46.016 --> 01:17:48.688
She has her mother's nose and forehead.

01:17:49.183 --> 01:17:51.849
Even she used to get dimples
when she smiled.

01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:54.150
She's in her, too.

01:17:55.308 --> 01:17:56.683
Look how she stands, sir!

01:17:58.183 --> 01:18:00.266
Does she look like a killer's daughter?

01:18:00.391 --> 01:18:02.766
Doesn't she look like a cop's daughter?
-Yes, Dilli.

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:05.141
I want to hold her right now!

01:18:05.266 --> 01:18:07.558
Then come!
If we go quickly, you can see her soon!

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.808
Will I see her, sir?
-Definitely, Dilli!

01:18:09.933 --> 01:18:12.433
How much further, sir?
-We're halfway there, bro!

01:18:12.558 --> 01:18:14.433
Cross the hill
and there's the hospital!

01:18:14.558 --> 01:18:15.558
Let's go, sir.

01:18:20.933 --> 01:18:23.224
Tips!
The vehicle's off.

01:18:24.224 --> 01:18:25.224
His name is Dilli!

01:18:26.016 --> 01:18:28.674
You must kill him first
to get close to the cops!

01:18:29.308 --> 01:18:31.384
What did you say his name was?
-Dilli!

01:19:15.769 --> 01:19:17.228
See if you can break any of these.

01:19:19.269 --> 01:19:20.978
Break it all down!
Go!

01:19:22.103 --> 01:19:23.478
Break them open!

01:19:24.345 --> 01:19:25.732
Hit hard!
-Break it!

01:19:27.626 --> 01:19:28.709
Break it!

01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:31.349
Made out of forest wood!
Can't break it!

01:19:31.415 --> 01:19:32.873
What is it?
-No, Anbu.

01:19:32.998 --> 01:19:36.248
Seems like an old British building.
Really strong doors and windows.

01:19:36.373 --> 01:19:38.165
Not so easy to break in.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:39.957
I'll see if there's another way in.

01:19:40.082 --> 01:19:42.082
Three of you go look that side!

01:19:42.808 --> 01:19:45.332
Where are you guys?
Hey, Tips!

01:19:46.165 --> 01:19:47.873
Tell everyone to stop!
-Get down!

01:19:47.998 --> 01:19:49.123
Hold on, guys!

01:19:49.559 --> 01:19:50.684
Stop!

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.540
Hey!

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:56.248
They savagely beat everyone
and drove up the hill!

01:19:56.373 --> 01:19:57.957
Who is he?

01:19:58.082 --> 01:19:59.582
His name's Dilli.

01:19:59.707 --> 01:20:01.332
It seems like he escaped prison.

01:20:01.457 --> 01:20:03.082
He's going around with handcuffs.

01:20:03.207 --> 01:20:05.165
Don't know why he's working
for the cops.

01:20:06.082 --> 01:20:08.457
He gores like a rhino, Mr. Prabha.

01:20:08.582 --> 01:20:11.498
He beat the crap
out of Krishna and Guna.

01:20:11.623 --> 01:20:14.790
He sports holy ash on his head
and dances around like God!

01:20:14.915 --> 01:20:18.082
Say you couldn't do it!
Don't bring God into this!

01:20:18.207 --> 01:20:20.040
Ajay! I'm near Thavakudi!

01:20:20.165 --> 01:20:22.832
Tell Tane that I asked him
to come to that high school!

01:20:22.957 --> 01:20:23.998
I'll call back.

01:20:25.123 --> 01:20:26.707
On my way, doctor!
-Bejoy!

01:20:27.623 --> 01:20:31.832
Based on my research, chances are high
that this drug may be Rohypnol.

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:34.082
So?
-It's a heavy sedative!

01:20:34.207 --> 01:20:35.915
Even more dangerous.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.832
But no one can acquire this drug.

01:20:37.957 --> 01:20:39.332
Hard to access it!

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:43.540
Someone in your department
who handles drugs must've done this.

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:47.332
Already been three hours, Bejoy.
Hurry!

01:20:47.457 --> 01:20:49.123
We delay further, people might die!

01:20:49.248 --> 01:20:50.915
Alright, doctor.
On my way!

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.165
'Even if a child forgets his mother...'

01:20:53.290 --> 01:20:55.748
'Or if a mother forgets her child...'

01:20:55.873 --> 01:20:58.582
'If life forgets the body...'

01:20:58.707 --> 01:21:01.082
'Or if the body forgets life...'

01:21:01.207 --> 01:21:03.373
'Even if you forget
all you have learned...'

01:21:03.498 --> 01:21:06.640
'Or if the eyes forget to blink...'

01:21:07.707 --> 01:21:10.121
'The Lord who rooted us here...'

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.790
'Namashivaaya...I shall never forget!'

01:21:15.332 --> 01:21:16.748
Praise be to Lord Shiva!

01:21:22.498 --> 01:21:24.957
Men have surrounded the hill!
They might hear you, bro!

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:28.373
I don't believe in this sort of thing!

01:21:29.082 --> 01:21:30.082
One day, you will.

01:21:31.748 --> 01:21:33.130
How many guys on your side?

01:21:34.165 --> 01:21:35.165
About seventeen.

01:21:36.248 --> 01:21:38.968
How many guys on our side?
-About twenty, brother.

01:21:39.836 --> 01:21:41.795
Let two guys watch
the centre of the hill.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.711
Forty of us will swoop down together!

01:21:43.836 --> 01:21:45.753
One guy covers every ten feet!

01:21:45.878 --> 01:21:48.086
What was his name?
Bombay? Delhi?

01:21:49.086 --> 01:21:50.961
Let's see how he gets down this hill!

01:21:57.461 --> 01:22:00.295
See that, sir? The guys who chased us
have surrounded the hill!

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.378
Wherever the truck goes,
they'll attack!

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.420
What do we do, Dilli?

01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:08.336
You tell me, sir.
I'll do it.

01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:10.420
If I tell you,
you'll ask if I'm crazy.

01:22:19.086 --> 01:22:19.943
Alright, tell me.

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:22.477
Hey, Tips! Can you see me?
-It's the boss!

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:24.852
Over here!
-Tell me!

01:22:25.685 --> 01:22:27.094
Tell me!
-Do you hear me?

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.518
Can you hear me?

01:22:29.643 --> 01:22:30.810
Yes!

01:22:30.935 --> 01:22:32.185
Listen up!

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.286
There's an iron door behind this building!
-What?

01:22:35.427 --> 01:22:36.599
Hoist me higher!

01:22:37.102 --> 01:22:38.352
An iron door!

01:22:38.477 --> 01:22:40.790
He's telling them of a way inside
from up there!

01:22:48.279 --> 01:22:49.060
Saw what's down there?

01:22:49.185 --> 01:22:52.193
Make it sound like it's nothing!
We get caught, only five die!

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.518
You're trying to kill us all?
Are you crazy?

01:22:55.435 --> 01:22:57.447
See that?
Said you'd react this way!

01:22:57.518 --> 01:22:58.893
Now you yourself...

01:22:59.018 --> 01:23:00.851
We're surrounded by forests!

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.226
He's stopped atop the hill!

01:23:03.351 --> 01:23:04.560
Don't know exactly where!

01:23:06.018 --> 01:23:07.893
Come by Thittakudi!

01:23:08.018 --> 01:23:09.351
See if there's a hill there!

01:23:09.476 --> 01:23:10.893
What's wrong?
-What is it, bro?

01:23:19.935 --> 01:23:21.810
They're just blubbering drunk!

01:23:21.935 --> 01:23:24.351
Shut up and sleep!
Don't know the situation we're in!

01:23:29.518 --> 01:23:31.726
An iron door!

01:23:31.851 --> 01:23:33.476
Iron what?
-An iron door!

01:23:33.601 --> 01:23:35.268
Iron door. Got it!
-In the back!

01:23:35.393 --> 01:23:38.268
There's an iron door in the back!
-Head back!

01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:39.643
An iron door!

01:23:39.768 --> 01:23:42.643
Can I do something to ensure
no one out can hear him?

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:43.935
What are you going to do?

01:23:45.185 --> 01:23:46.185
Are you there?

01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:07.624
Guide me, O Lord Shiva!

01:24:08.268 --> 01:24:10.435
Come on!
The truck's heading this way!

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.185
Come!
We'll pin it down!

01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:13.851
Truck's coming this way!
Come on!

01:24:29.851 --> 01:24:31.435
The truck's on that side!
Come on!

01:24:33.726 --> 01:24:34.976
Get up!
Watch your step!

01:25:41.726 --> 01:25:42.935
Come along, sir!

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:51.226
Come quickly, sir!

01:25:51.351 --> 01:25:53.518
Pull over somewhere, bro!
-Don't spare them!

01:25:53.643 --> 01:25:55.060
Come on, guys!

01:25:58.601 --> 01:26:00.310
Get in quickly!

01:26:01.226 --> 01:26:02.393
Get in!

01:26:07.393 --> 01:26:09.178
Come on, sir!
-Where's Sir?

01:26:11.393 --> 01:26:12.768
He's out there!

01:26:12.893 --> 01:26:14.560
Make sure he gets in!
-Come on, sir!

01:26:16.643 --> 01:26:18.768
Come on, sir!
You're close!

01:26:18.893 --> 01:26:20.726
Come! Take my hand, sir!
-Kill him!

01:26:20.851 --> 01:26:22.427
Hurry up, sir!

01:26:23.075 --> 01:26:23.833
Sir!

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.685
They managed to strike him, bro!

01:26:34.643 --> 01:26:36.601
What do we do now, bro?

01:26:53.518 --> 01:26:54.643
Brother!

01:26:54.768 --> 01:26:55.976
He's the guy, brother!

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:00.518
What the hell?

01:27:00.643 --> 01:27:02.060
So much build-up!

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.560
Hey!

01:27:05.101 --> 01:27:06.518
I don't know who you are!

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.810
I don't know why you work for the cops!

01:27:09.935 --> 01:27:12.435
All I want are five guys inside the truck!

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.560
Hey!
Give me that!

01:27:14.685 --> 01:27:17.851
Bejoy, Thiru, Kumar, Joseph
and Sudhakar!

01:27:17.976 --> 01:27:21.393
Just hand me these guys
and go on your way with the rest!

01:27:21.518 --> 01:27:22.518
Hey!

01:27:23.643 --> 01:27:26.143
I gave my word
that I'd drop them at their destination!

01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:31.325
Settle your dispute
after I've dropped them off!

01:27:32.143 --> 01:27:34.101
Hey!
Go get them.

01:27:34.226 --> 01:27:35.226
Shoot.

01:27:37.726 --> 01:27:39.435
Bro...
-That chump has a gun!

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.768
It's just a toy gun!
Go!

01:27:41.893 --> 01:27:42.893
Pull the trigger!

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.435
He's got a gun, brother!

01:27:48.768 --> 01:27:50.393
If you're scared,
close your eyes!

01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:56.226
Are you a cop
to shoot below the knee?

01:27:56.351 --> 01:27:58.226
He'll account for the bullets!

01:27:58.351 --> 01:27:59.351
Blow their brains out!

01:27:59.476 --> 01:28:00.476
Bravely step up!

01:28:00.601 --> 01:28:03.101
Don't make stupid decisions
because of money!

01:28:03.226 --> 01:28:04.643
He's shooting at us blindly!

01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:13.310
Shoot the thin guy in the corner!

01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:16.601
Two more bullets left!

01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:18.638
If they dare to take a step,
shoot away!

01:28:46.351 --> 01:28:49.060
Strong iron door!
Won't break even if we pound at it all day!

01:28:49.185 --> 01:28:51.310
Break the wall!
-Talked like you're a big shot!

01:28:57.101 --> 01:28:58.101
Go that side...

01:29:14.393 --> 01:29:15.560
Hello?
-Careful!

01:29:15.685 --> 01:29:17.810
What happened, Tips?
-No, Anbu.

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:21.643
Some guy named Dilli got involved
and saved all the cops.

01:29:21.768 --> 01:29:24.393
Took out about three groups, too.
-Aren't you ashamed?

01:29:25.435 --> 01:29:27.226
Aren't you ashamed to say that?

01:29:27.351 --> 01:29:28.351
Hey...

01:29:28.935 --> 01:29:30.768
You better toss me the key
and get lost!

01:29:35.197 --> 01:29:36.877
If I ever get out of here...

01:29:37.476 --> 01:29:41.060
I'll kill not just you,
but every last member of your family!

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:43.268
Toss me the key!

01:29:43.393 --> 01:29:45.268
(A song plays loudly
in the music system)

01:29:52.101 --> 01:29:53.476
Break it quickly!

01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:55.351
Hold on!
Come along!

01:29:55.476 --> 01:29:57.685
(A fast paced song plays)

01:30:06.143 --> 01:30:07.719
Why are you stopping?
Keep at it!

01:30:09.018 --> 01:30:10.101
Break it open!

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:16.310
Turn it off.

01:30:22.226 --> 01:30:23.226
Turn that thing off.

01:30:25.593 --> 01:30:26.968
Turn that damn thing off.

01:30:27.585 --> 01:30:29.044
Turn that goddamn thing off!

01:30:29.373 --> 01:30:30.498
Turn it off!

01:30:30.623 --> 01:30:33.331
Once I'm out,
I won't bloody spare any one of you!

01:30:34.873 --> 01:30:36.456
Can't handle one man?

01:30:36.581 --> 01:30:39.206
They've arrested my brother!
All five cops must die!

01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:41.806
If you got guts,
don't call until it's done! Hang up!

01:30:50.373 --> 01:30:51.498
Hey!
-Brother?

01:30:51.623 --> 01:30:52.873
Start the vehicle!
-Okay!

01:30:54.648 --> 01:30:55.648
Sampath!

01:30:58.731 --> 01:30:59.731
Sampath!

01:31:12.064 --> 01:31:13.939
Tips can't handle this situation!

01:31:14.064 --> 01:31:15.356
You get going!

01:31:15.481 --> 01:31:17.064
The cops should not reach here!

01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:19.981
But the cargo is still inside!

01:31:20.106 --> 01:31:21.523
I'll handle that!
Now go!

01:31:24.106 --> 01:31:25.106
What happened?

01:31:40.148 --> 01:31:41.087
Sir?

01:31:41.423 --> 01:31:42.274
Sir?

01:31:46.731 --> 01:31:47.898
Sprinkle water on him.

01:31:54.564 --> 01:31:56.357
He's still not waking up, bro.

01:31:59.689 --> 01:32:02.157
Bro...
You need to turn left here.

01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:11.314
Few folks in the list of Academy Toppers
haven't gotten a posting yet.

01:32:11.439 --> 01:32:13.606
Very likely they're working undercover now.

01:32:13.731 --> 01:32:15.231
Tell me their names.

01:32:15.356 --> 01:32:17.023
Just a minute, sir.

01:32:17.148 --> 01:32:18.148
Sathya.

01:32:18.273 --> 01:32:19.273
Sathya...

01:32:20.064 --> 01:32:21.148
Gunasekaran.

01:32:21.273 --> 01:32:22.273
Gunasekaran...

01:32:22.466 --> 01:32:23.388
Ajaz Ahmed

01:32:23.481 --> 01:32:24.481
Alright, hang up.

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:49.939
How much longer?

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.481
(A peppy song plays)

01:32:52.375 --> 01:32:53.156
Ram!

01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:44.481
Yes, this is it.

01:33:44.606 --> 01:33:46.023
This is the place he mentioned.

01:33:46.148 --> 01:33:48.564
Think there'll be no further problems, bro.

01:33:49.814 --> 01:33:51.106
What do we do with him?

01:33:52.106 --> 01:33:53.439
Hold his legs.

01:34:00.981 --> 01:34:02.398
Prop his head up.

01:34:12.218 --> 01:34:14.273
Where is he?
-At Thavakudi School, Tips!

01:34:14.398 --> 01:34:16.273
You said he's going to a hospital.

01:34:16.398 --> 01:34:19.314
Why's he going to a school?
-Did he give me a damn itinerary?

01:34:19.439 --> 01:34:20.439
Hurry up!

01:34:32.898 --> 01:34:33.898
Good evening, sir!

01:34:52.814 --> 01:34:55.109
Ram! Ravi!

01:35:18.564 --> 01:35:19.731
They're done for, today!

01:35:22.731 --> 01:35:23.856
Anbu!

01:35:23.981 --> 01:35:25.689
Where's Anbu?
-I don't know, brother!

01:35:25.814 --> 01:35:28.189
No path here. Check that side!
-Let's go!

01:35:32.939 --> 01:35:34.023
Sir!

01:35:34.148 --> 01:35:36.439
They're about to break the back door!

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:40.148
Heeding your words, I made those four boys
and the girl stay back here!

01:35:40.273 --> 01:35:41.856
When will you come?
-Sir...

01:35:41.981 --> 01:35:43.689
Mr. Bejoy can't come to the phone now.

01:35:43.814 --> 01:35:44.814
Who the hell are you?

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.939
Where is he?
Do you know what's going on here?

01:35:48.064 --> 01:35:50.689
I do, sir!
Been a part of this since it began!

01:35:50.814 --> 01:35:53.773
Don't be scared!
High ranking officials are on the way!

01:35:53.898 --> 01:35:55.981
I've heard the same thing for hours!

01:35:56.106 --> 01:35:57.981
If they get in,
they'll hack all of us up!

01:35:58.106 --> 01:36:00.106
Mr. Bejoy'd have to answer for this!

01:36:00.231 --> 01:36:01.898
First tell me who you are!

01:36:02.023 --> 01:36:03.231
I'm just like you, sir.

01:36:03.356 --> 01:36:05.481
A stranger in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

01:36:07.939 --> 01:36:09.273
Look in that place!
-Sir!

01:36:09.398 --> 01:36:10.939
Do you see anyone?
-It's Anbu!

01:36:13.606 --> 01:36:15.439
How many of you are in there?

01:36:15.564 --> 01:36:18.064
Including the girl,
there are five people!

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:19.939
Trusting him, I had them stay back!

01:36:20.064 --> 01:36:22.564
Do they know who Mr. Bejoy is?

01:36:22.689 --> 01:36:24.398
I haven't seen him myself!

01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:30.023
The key is with that cop, Anbu!

01:36:31.856 --> 01:36:33.523
First turn that bloody thing off!

01:36:36.606 --> 01:36:40.314
Tell me, sir. How can they trust a guy
whom even you haven't seen before?

01:36:40.439 --> 01:36:42.523
They trust you.

01:36:43.481 --> 01:36:45.439
Only we must take care
of those who trust us.

01:36:46.148 --> 01:36:48.564
What?
Afraid you'll die, huh?

01:36:48.689 --> 01:36:50.814
Even if you die,
put up one hell of a fight, sir!

01:36:51.731 --> 01:36:53.439
Don't die cowering in fear!

01:36:53.564 --> 01:36:55.189
Sir...
-You're a cop, right?

01:36:55.314 --> 01:36:58.062
If anyone dares to step in there,
beat the crap out of him!

01:36:58.992 --> 01:36:59.804
Hello!

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.039
Sir!

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:52.148
Careful, bro!

01:37:56.622 --> 01:37:58.021
Hold him, Ashok!

01:38:00.939 --> 01:38:02.552
Don't let him go!
-Be Careful

01:38:05.228 --> 01:38:06.768
Hit him!

01:38:09.393 --> 01:38:11.352
Grab his leg!
-Give me a hand!

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.018
Come on!
-Do something, sir!

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.893
Careful, sir!

01:38:20.018 --> 01:38:21.102
Back away, Tamizh!

01:38:22.227 --> 01:38:24.143
Kick that knife away!

01:38:24.268 --> 01:38:26.018
Don't go near him, Chittu!

01:38:26.143 --> 01:38:27.185
Come here!

01:38:32.477 --> 01:38:34.810
Where's the key?
-See if any door on the top is open!

01:38:34.935 --> 01:38:36.018
Go look!

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.893
Stop right there!

01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:21.435
Get up, sir!

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.977
Break it, guys!

01:39:27.852 --> 01:39:29.311
Bend those bars!

01:39:40.893 --> 01:39:42.143
Come on!

01:39:42.268 --> 01:39:43.268
Go check that side!

01:39:45.393 --> 01:39:46.393
Be careful!

01:39:47.477 --> 01:39:49.227
No way here!
It's locked!

01:39:49.352 --> 01:39:50.727
Look that side!

01:39:50.852 --> 01:39:51.852
Come, Chittu!

01:39:55.185 --> 01:39:56.477
Come on!
-Hold on!

01:39:57.505 --> 01:39:58.643
Grab his hands!

01:39:58.768 --> 01:39:59.935
Grab them!

01:40:01.143 --> 01:40:02.268
Come, Tamizh!

01:40:02.393 --> 01:40:04.102
Throw me your shawl!
-Here you go!

01:40:04.227 --> 01:40:05.393
Hold him down!

01:40:05.518 --> 01:40:06.852
Grab his hands!
-Tightly!

01:40:06.977 --> 01:40:08.018
Tie it tightly, Ajay!

01:40:13.527 --> 01:40:16.435
Bro!
This gun is so damn heavy!

01:40:16.819 --> 01:40:19.110
Can't shoot with one hand
like they do in the movies!

01:40:19.235 --> 01:40:20.777
It even drags me off to one side!

01:40:21.777 --> 01:40:23.152
Somehow, I managed.

01:40:25.027 --> 01:40:27.319
If I had not come along,
you two would've died, right?

01:40:31.194 --> 01:40:32.652
What is this?
No one's come!

01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:34.819
Shall I go take a look?
-Just sit quietly.

01:40:38.069 --> 01:40:39.610
Who are you, bro?

01:40:40.194 --> 01:40:41.319
Why did you kill?

01:40:42.485 --> 01:40:44.652
Just that you look like a killer.

01:40:44.777 --> 01:40:46.235
But you don't seem to be one!

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.194
That's why I asked.
Tell me, bro.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.541
Just mind your business.

01:40:50.682 --> 01:40:52.572
Just tell me, bro.

01:40:55.765 --> 01:40:56.765
Tell me.

01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:02.009
How old are you?
-Just turned 23!

01:41:05.728 --> 01:41:07.645
When I was your age,
I had seen everything.

01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:12.020
As long as I can remember...

01:41:13.103 --> 01:41:16.228
...I was acclimated with fighting
and drinking. Remained that way!

01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:20.270
Viji.

01:41:22.561 --> 01:41:23.728
If she had not come along...

01:41:24.728 --> 01:41:26.603
...I would've been the same
until I died.

01:41:28.103 --> 01:41:29.103
She looked so good!

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.978
All eyes were on her!

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.228
But she was really fond of me!

01:41:39.478 --> 01:41:42.560
Dead set on marrying me,
she chased me all over and did so!

01:41:45.561 --> 01:41:47.884
Our home was under a tarp on a platform!

01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:52.353
To her, it was like living in a palace.
She was so happy.

01:41:53.895 --> 01:41:54.895
Every day...

01:41:56.395 --> 01:41:59.478
She'd ask me to keep flowers on her hair.
Mark holy ash on her forehead.

01:42:00.395 --> 01:42:03.811
She'd always swish around,
telling me to eat something she made.

01:42:07.061 --> 01:42:08.895
I hadn't known what life was.

01:42:10.212 --> 01:42:12.212
For the first time,
I wanted to live.

01:42:16.045 --> 01:42:18.795
If someone's born blind,
just let them be.

01:42:20.985 --> 01:42:23.146
But if you give them sight
for a while...

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.670
...and yank it away
when they're happy?

01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:31.436
One day...
It was a Friday...

01:42:32.894 --> 01:42:34.269
A Vijaykanth film.

01:42:35.769 --> 01:42:38.978
Everyone in the platform
had gone for a late night show.

01:42:40.936 --> 01:42:42.394
Only the two of us didn't go.

01:42:42.947 --> 01:42:44.239
Because she was pregnant.

01:42:46.239 --> 01:42:49.187
We shut shop
and lay down to sleep.

01:42:51.156 --> 01:42:52.156
All of a sudden...

01:42:53.239 --> 01:42:54.864
...she screamed out to me!

01:42:57.072 --> 01:42:58.239
When I opened my eyes...

01:42:59.322 --> 01:43:00.864
...two bloody mongrels...

01:43:02.114 --> 01:43:05.114
...without even caring she was pregnant,
were carrying her away!

01:43:06.697 --> 01:43:07.864
What would you have done?

01:43:10.572 --> 01:43:12.531
I beat them.
I beat them hard.

01:43:13.864 --> 01:43:15.602
I beat them until they were dead!

01:43:18.989 --> 01:43:20.864
When they arrested me
and took me away...

01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:24.739
...that pregnant girl
stood in the middle of the road...

01:43:26.281 --> 01:43:28.469
...and cried asking me not to leave her.

01:43:33.322 --> 01:43:36.383
I didn't know back then
that it was the last time I'd ever see her.

01:43:42.447 --> 01:43:43.947
In the blink of an eye...

01:43:45.156 --> 01:43:46.322
...everything was gone.

01:43:49.947 --> 01:43:51.156
Her voice...

01:43:53.197 --> 01:43:54.406
The scent of her sweat...

01:43:57.739 --> 01:43:59.489
I have those memories
keep me going.

01:44:04.572 --> 01:44:05.572
Bro...

01:44:06.906 --> 01:44:08.406
Did she die?

01:44:24.281 --> 01:44:26.739
What is it?
Why are you still up?

01:44:28.239 --> 01:44:29.239
No, sister...

01:44:29.364 --> 01:44:33.447
I don't think anyone is coming
to visit me tomorrow.

01:44:34.572 --> 01:44:36.281
Are you crazy?

01:44:36.406 --> 01:44:39.572
I talked so much
but no one talked back.

01:44:39.697 --> 01:44:42.104
Doesn't that mean
they don't like me?

01:44:43.572 --> 01:44:45.697
Nothing of that sort.
You'll see.

01:44:45.822 --> 01:44:47.239
They'll come to visit you.

01:45:05.906 --> 01:45:07.406
Get going, brother.

01:45:07.531 --> 01:45:09.923
Forget the truck.
I'll take care of it. You go!

01:45:10.864 --> 01:45:12.739
How do I leave this halfway?

01:45:13.864 --> 01:45:16.406
That's familiar territory to them.
They'll handle it.

01:45:16.531 --> 01:45:18.406
You focus on meeting your child.
Go!

01:45:19.406 --> 01:45:21.114
Like me, that man has a daughter, too.

01:45:22.322 --> 01:45:23.322
He's a good man.

01:45:23.447 --> 01:45:26.614
How do you know? What if he shows
his cop tricks in the morning?

01:45:26.739 --> 01:45:28.781
I've been in jail for ten years
with evil men.

01:45:29.781 --> 01:45:31.447
Good men look like temples to me.

01:45:31.572 --> 01:45:35.947
Some big shot! You promised to meet a girl
who thought she was an orphan until now!

01:45:36.072 --> 01:45:39.947
How would she feel if her dad
gets hacked to death on the way?

01:45:40.072 --> 01:45:43.156
The govt. will protect the cop's family.
Who'll take care of yours?

01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:45.864
Enough with helping others!
Go take care of your life!

01:45:45.989 --> 01:45:47.531
I'm pleading with you.
Please go!

01:45:48.781 --> 01:45:49.906
Just go, brother!

01:45:59.322 --> 01:46:01.489
What do we do with him, sir?

01:46:01.614 --> 01:46:04.506
Do you hear me, Anbu?
-Shall we lock him up in another cell?

01:46:04.531 --> 01:46:07.156
Why aren't you replying?
-Hold on. Let me ask Sir.

01:46:07.281 --> 01:46:08.281
Hey, Anbu!

01:46:08.989 --> 01:46:11.281
Damn it!
Someone respond!

01:46:12.156 --> 01:46:13.156
Anbu!

01:46:21.579 --> 01:46:24.688
"The number you're calling
is switched off at the moment."

01:46:43.242 --> 01:46:45.575
I sent someone
who can handle the arms.

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.659
They stabbed him
near the checkpost, sir!

01:46:47.784 --> 01:46:50.950
I don't know who did it or anything else.
-Alright, do this.

01:46:51.075 --> 01:46:53.575
Put these two bodies
into the school bus and go.

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.659
Alright.
-I've spoken to Dr. Amudhan.

01:46:55.784 --> 01:46:59.200
It's very important that no one else
knows about this.

01:46:59.325 --> 01:47:00.659
Got it?
-Alright, sir.

01:47:00.784 --> 01:47:02.409
Take them to the Jojo Clinic.

01:47:02.534 --> 01:47:04.450
Say it's an emergency.
He'll understand.

01:47:04.575 --> 01:47:06.034
Okay.
-Let them remain with Ajay.

01:47:06.159 --> 01:47:07.159
Okay, sir.

01:47:10.825 --> 01:47:11.992
Tell him you're leaving.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.117
You get going. I'll join up with the boys.
-Yes, sir.

01:47:19.242 --> 01:47:20.367
Hey...

01:47:20.492 --> 01:47:22.367
I came to see my child.

01:47:23.075 --> 01:47:24.617
I've seen what she looks like.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.909
I've heard her voice, too.

01:47:27.034 --> 01:47:29.034
Now I want her to be well!

01:47:29.159 --> 01:47:30.867
This man offered to help with that!

01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:34.867
What if I live through this
but something happens to him?

01:47:34.992 --> 01:47:37.200
Both our kids' lives will be ruined!
-So?

01:47:38.992 --> 01:47:42.325
It's not imporant for me to be with her.
Her happiness is more important.

01:47:45.117 --> 01:47:48.875
I've decided to save that man's life,
even if it means I lose mine.

01:47:49.075 --> 01:47:53.625
If she has a good school, think your child
will be happy even without her parents?

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:55.367
Hey...

01:47:56.034 --> 01:47:57.409
You won't understand this.

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:00.117
Can you do me a favor?

01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:05.325
When I was in prison,
I worked in a bakery for three years.

01:48:06.325 --> 01:48:08.117
With the money I saved from it...

01:48:08.242 --> 01:48:10.700
...as I was wondering what to buy
for her...

01:48:10.825 --> 01:48:13.825
...I remembered
that Viji loved 'jimikki' earrings.

01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:15.867
So, I bought the same.

01:48:17.075 --> 01:48:19.196
If anything happens to me
at the Commissioner's office...

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:21.337
...can you get this to my daughter?

01:48:24.575 --> 01:48:25.742
Be careful.

01:48:29.825 --> 01:48:30.867
Say her father gave it.

01:48:32.492 --> 01:48:34.242
If she asks where he was...
-In prison.

01:48:34.367 --> 01:48:35.825
You dolt!

01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:37.200
What else do I say, brother?

01:48:40.992 --> 01:48:43.385
Tell her I was a painter in Dubai.

01:49:03.409 --> 01:49:05.464
We're going in a school bus, sir.

01:49:06.242 --> 01:49:09.242
Yes, to a hospital.
I'll let Tips know which hospital.

01:49:09.367 --> 01:49:11.825
That's an issue
between them and the cops.

01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:13.284
They'll handle it.

01:49:13.409 --> 01:49:16.700
But if Bejoy is left alive,
we'll be caught.

01:49:16.825 --> 01:49:17.909
Sir...

01:49:18.034 --> 01:49:19.325
Somehow, finish him off.

01:49:20.325 --> 01:49:21.492
How do I do that, sir?

01:49:21.617 --> 01:49:22.867
Don't be scared.

01:49:22.992 --> 01:49:25.159
Bejoy's men can't do anything,
tonight.

01:49:25.284 --> 01:49:28.909
Higher officials are involved with this.
So, they can't talk about this openly.

01:49:29.034 --> 01:49:31.200
Do what I say.
We'll handle it.

01:49:31.325 --> 01:49:32.742
Alright, sir.

01:49:34.742 --> 01:49:36.867
Pull over, driver!
Stop!

01:49:44.992 --> 01:49:46.659
Appears he's out of the funk, sir.

01:49:46.797 --> 01:49:47.571
Sir!

01:49:47.985 --> 01:49:48.696
Sir!

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:52.234
I'm feeling better, sir.
Can I ride with you?

01:50:01.034 --> 01:50:01.987
Chittu?

01:50:02.322 --> 01:50:03.057
Chittu?

01:50:04.712 --> 01:50:05.825
Does it hurt?

01:50:09.078 --> 01:50:09.883
Hey..

01:50:11.492 --> 01:50:12.492
Hey...

01:50:13.601 --> 01:50:16.718
Sorry I slapped you.

01:50:27.575 --> 01:50:28.700
I love you.

01:50:35.075 --> 01:50:36.950
What happened, Anbu?
Look at me!

01:50:37.075 --> 01:50:38.700
Look at me, I say!

01:50:38.825 --> 01:50:41.075
Untie him!
Do it!

01:50:41.992 --> 01:50:44.492
Give him the key!
-Release Anbu and I'll let him go!

01:50:44.617 --> 01:50:47.409
He might do something! Give the key!
-Open up and I'll let him go!

01:50:47.477 --> 01:50:50.075
Open the door!
-Who the hell are you to decide that?

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.534
He's in your grasp
and you keep talking?

01:50:52.659 --> 01:50:54.367
Take him out!
Do it!

01:50:58.744 --> 01:50:59.911
Chittu!

01:51:18.742 --> 01:51:21.492
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I bloody tell you?

01:51:21.617 --> 01:51:23.492
It's all your fault!

01:51:23.617 --> 01:51:26.284
Had you given the key then,
he'd be alive right now!

01:51:27.159 --> 01:51:31.117
Now just him, but him,
him and her!

01:51:31.242 --> 01:51:33.325
There are thirty guys outside!

01:51:33.450 --> 01:51:36.188
Thought about what would happen
to you all if they came in?

01:51:38.242 --> 01:51:41.617
Brother!
I'll have the key in another two minutes!

01:51:41.742 --> 01:51:44.159
We'll take the cargo
and go home together!

01:51:44.284 --> 01:51:46.117
Together!
Now give me the key!

01:51:46.242 --> 01:51:48.825
What happened?
Where are the rest of them?

01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.325
Anbu!

01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:57.830
Chittu!

01:52:00.075 --> 01:52:01.075
Chittu!

01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:05.227
Chittu!

01:52:10.325 --> 01:52:11.867
He's dead, sir!

01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:17.992
Didn't he stay back
because you asked him to, sir?

01:52:20.284 --> 01:52:22.534
He's just a corpse now, sir!

01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:28.825
Get up!
-Do you hear that?

01:52:30.524 --> 01:52:32.313
Chittu!

01:52:59.784 --> 01:53:01.534
Talk to me, Anbu!

01:53:02.534 --> 01:53:03.534
Anbu!

01:53:04.409 --> 01:53:06.575
Can you hear me, Anbu?
-Hey, Anbu!

01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.325
Say something, Anbu!
-Come on!

01:53:10.424 --> 01:53:11.455
Anbu!

01:53:12.825 --> 01:53:15.007
They did something to Anbu, brother!

01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:16.288
Anbu!
-Anbu!

01:53:16.577 --> 01:53:18.537
Hey Anbu...

01:53:19.162 --> 01:53:21.116
What have you done to Anbu?

01:53:22.909 --> 01:53:25.075
Tips! Ram!
Where are you guys?

01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.992
What happened to Anbu?

01:53:27.117 --> 01:53:29.617
Go check the back side!
Move!

01:53:33.492 --> 01:53:34.909
You're all dead meat!

01:53:35.784 --> 01:53:36.867
Open the door!

01:53:36.992 --> 01:53:38.367
Open the damn door!

01:53:50.784 --> 01:53:52.539
Ajaz Ahmed.

01:54:28.075 --> 01:54:30.617
Once we cross the quarry,
we reach town!

01:54:30.742 --> 01:54:33.159
Easy to go to the Commissioner's office
from there.

01:55:05.575 --> 01:55:06.575
Sir...

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:09.075
No matter what,
don't leave the vehicle.

01:55:18.909 --> 01:55:20.159
Listen up!

01:55:21.075 --> 01:55:23.034
The cops you're looking for
are not here.

01:55:23.159 --> 01:55:25.325
I've sent them off!
I'm Dilli!

01:55:25.950 --> 01:55:27.325
I got this, sir.
Get back!

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.492
I beat up your guys.

01:55:29.617 --> 01:55:31.413
Got anything to discuss,
take it up with me...

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:32.398
Bro...

01:55:32.867 --> 01:55:33.554
Dilli!

01:55:34.325 --> 01:55:36.325
This is it, sir!
He tipped them off!

01:55:38.077 --> 01:55:39.054
Dilli

01:55:43.825 --> 01:55:45.992
Hey! The gun has no bullets!
Come on, guys!

01:55:46.117 --> 01:55:47.409
Let him go!
-Come on!

01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:54.784
Come quickly!

01:55:54.909 --> 01:55:56.659
No! Listen to me!
Now go!

01:55:58.867 --> 01:55:59.992
Get going, I say!

01:56:03.909 --> 01:56:05.117
If I ever catch you...

01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:25.950
Just finish him off!

01:56:28.242 --> 01:56:29.242
Tell me!

01:56:30.284 --> 01:56:31.825
Sent them off in a school bus, huh?

01:56:32.992 --> 01:56:33.992
To which hospital?

01:56:35.617 --> 01:56:36.784
I don't know.

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:38.950
"Don't know"?

01:56:44.075 --> 01:56:45.165
You don't know, eh?

01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:50.200
Make the guys check
every hospital in the area!

01:56:50.325 --> 01:56:52.075
Check if a school bus
is parked there!

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.575
Let's see how they escape!

01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:55.117
First let's finish him off!

01:56:56.284 --> 01:56:57.284
Drop the rock.

01:56:57.409 --> 01:57:00.534
You'll leave once your job's done!
I'll be in trouble if he stays alive!

01:57:00.659 --> 01:57:02.284
Let's kill him!
-Drop it, I say!

01:57:09.659 --> 01:57:11.954
Can't nab one schmuck?
Hurry!

01:57:13.034 --> 01:57:14.742
He must be around there!
Search!

01:57:14.867 --> 01:57:16.659
Quit calling repeatedly!

01:57:16.784 --> 01:57:17.899
Catch him and get here!

01:57:18.784 --> 01:57:20.992
Call your man in the bus.

01:57:22.325 --> 01:57:24.367
I've asked you many times!
Do it!

01:57:24.492 --> 01:57:27.159
Give that to me, sir.
I'll handle it.

01:57:27.284 --> 01:57:28.325
Just give it!

01:57:35.075 --> 01:57:36.075
Come here!

01:57:37.096 --> 01:57:39.471
Take the gun in my pocket, sir!

01:57:40.575 --> 01:57:42.075
Don't hesitate!
Take it, sir!

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:43.669
There's no time.
Hurry!

01:57:45.367 --> 01:57:46.765
I think you got busted.

01:57:48.534 --> 01:57:49.534
I'm sorry.

01:57:51.492 --> 01:57:52.867
You should've left back then.

01:57:53.784 --> 01:57:55.034
Because of me...

01:58:01.367 --> 01:58:03.325
If you had a shave,
he'd look just like you!

01:58:03.992 --> 01:58:04.992
Right?

01:58:09.742 --> 01:58:10.742
Don't!

01:58:11.992 --> 01:58:13.534
Let him go!

01:58:15.534 --> 01:58:16.742
No!
Let him go!

01:58:18.367 --> 01:58:20.159
No!
Just leave him alone!

01:58:23.075 --> 01:58:24.075
Ajaz!

01:58:33.742 --> 01:58:36.138
Now do you realize
who the sheep is, Sampath?

01:58:41.409 --> 01:58:43.367
My name isn't Sampath.

01:58:43.492 --> 01:58:44.492
It's Ajaz Ahmed!

01:58:45.575 --> 01:58:48.284
Batch of 2016!
Academy Topper!

01:58:50.159 --> 01:58:52.117
I've been by your side
for two years.

01:58:53.242 --> 01:58:54.825
And you didn't even know!

01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:56.534
You're the damn sheep!

01:59:01.992 --> 01:59:02.992
Ajaz!

01:59:08.575 --> 01:59:10.117
Hey!
Toss him out.

01:59:11.367 --> 01:59:12.992
He's up!
Grab him!

01:59:13.117 --> 01:59:14.117
Hit him!

01:59:47.692 --> 01:59:48.942
We must get them out!

01:59:56.434 --> 01:59:57.767
What happened, Jaga?

01:59:57.852 --> 01:59:59.602
They blocked everything, brother!

01:59:59.727 --> 02:00:01.102
There's no way to get in!

02:00:05.644 --> 02:00:06.810
Pull, guys!

02:00:10.477 --> 02:00:12.227
Come along!

02:00:13.477 --> 02:00:15.429
We got him!
He's got something in his pocket!

02:00:15.484 --> 02:00:18.394
He won't let us take it!
-Don't spare anything! Check him!

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.958
Let go!
-Tips! Gaja's calling!

02:00:21.083 --> 02:00:22.833
Something happened to Anbu!
-What?

02:00:22.958 --> 02:00:25.000
He called many times.
Seems you didn't pick up!

02:00:25.125 --> 02:00:26.375
Let go of me!

02:00:28.875 --> 02:00:30.542
Give me that!
-Earrings, brother!

02:00:31.125 --> 02:00:32.167
What happened to Anbu?

02:00:33.250 --> 02:00:34.333
I'm coming!
Hang up!

02:00:34.693 --> 02:00:36.500
Brother!
Look!

02:00:38.042 --> 02:00:41.000
Brother! They snatched the earrings
you bought for your child!

02:00:41.125 --> 02:00:42.667
Open your eyes and look, brother!

02:00:44.125 --> 02:00:45.292
Are you kidding around?

02:00:45.917 --> 02:00:49.000
They broke the earrings
you bought for your child, brother!

02:00:50.458 --> 02:00:52.542
They broke your child's earrings!

02:00:54.792 --> 02:00:56.292
Brother!

02:00:56.417 --> 02:00:58.208
Open your eyes, brother!

02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.500
Stab him properly!

02:01:24.269 --> 02:01:25.769
Ajaz!

02:01:25.894 --> 02:01:27.872
Don't die on me, Ajaz!
Open your eyes!

02:01:28.771 --> 02:01:31.333
Run over the door with the car!
I'm on my way!

02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:45.407
Open your eyes, Ajaz!

02:02:52.394 --> 02:02:53.571
Don't let him go!

02:02:56.852 --> 02:02:59.935
You promised to meet a girl
who thought she was an orphan until now!

02:02:59.992 --> 02:03:04.140
How would she feel if her dad
gets hacked to death on the way?

02:03:06.685 --> 02:03:08.394
Do you want to see your daughter or not?

02:03:09.532 --> 02:03:11.357
Hello! I am Amudha speaking

02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:13.557
Are you coming to see me tommorrow

02:03:13.732 --> 02:03:14.693
Hello!

02:03:15.894 --> 02:03:16.894
Will I see her, sir?

02:03:19.102 --> 02:03:20.102
How are we related?

02:05:32.156 --> 02:05:33.156
Sir!

02:05:34.489 --> 02:05:35.656
Are you still alive, sir?

02:05:36.739 --> 02:05:38.156
If yes,
get inside the vehicle!

02:05:38.989 --> 02:05:39.989
Let's go!

02:05:45.864 --> 02:05:47.073
Come, dear!

02:05:47.198 --> 02:05:49.531
Listen to me!
Come, let's go!

02:05:49.656 --> 02:05:52.198
Don't know what they'll do
if they come in! Let's go!

02:05:53.406 --> 02:05:54.406
Come on!

02:05:56.531 --> 02:05:57.656
Everyone head up!

02:05:58.573 --> 02:05:59.823
Keep going!
Don't stop!

02:05:59.948 --> 02:06:02.114
Break it open!

02:06:02.614 --> 02:06:04.864
Get inside!
Go in, dear!

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.560
Sir! Sir! Sir!...

02:06:09.698 --> 02:06:15.008
If they're in, no matter what happens,
they must not lay hands on her! See to it.

02:06:28.864 --> 02:06:30.406
Break it!

02:06:30.531 --> 02:06:31.614
Hit it harder!

02:06:31.739 --> 02:06:34.531
Rip out that tree and slam it here!
Bring whatever you find!

02:06:37.117 --> 02:06:39.114
Break it open!

02:06:39.239 --> 02:06:41.198
Hit it hard!

02:06:41.323 --> 02:06:42.323
Come this side!

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.614
Break it open!

02:07:02.739 --> 02:07:04.739
Move aside!
-Where are you going?

02:07:04.864 --> 02:07:06.906
This building...
-Give me the key, sir.

02:07:12.156 --> 02:07:13.864
Hit it hard!

02:07:20.639 --> 02:07:21.624
Hey Dilli!

02:07:22.614 --> 02:07:25.198
No matter what,
Adaikalam must not get out!

02:07:25.906 --> 02:07:28.823
The boys will be here in...
-That's a cop's problem, sir.

02:07:28.948 --> 02:07:30.739
There are others like me
stuck in there.

02:07:30.864 --> 02:07:32.281
Who will save them?

02:07:34.507 --> 02:07:35.757
Got any left?

02:07:35.882 --> 02:07:37.048
Booze, kiddo!

02:07:39.757 --> 02:07:41.007
Break it open!

02:07:41.132 --> 02:07:42.382
Break the window!

02:08:02.949 --> 02:08:03.949
Sir...

02:08:04.715 --> 02:08:07.757
You've sworn upon your child
that you'll give my child a good life.

02:08:08.548 --> 02:08:12.711
If you think when I'm dead,
I wouldn't know that you broke your word...

02:08:13.590 --> 02:08:15.291
...I'll kill you, sir!

02:08:17.257 --> 02:08:20.092
Break it down!
Harder!

02:08:28.798 --> 02:08:29.798
Brother!

02:08:30.965 --> 02:08:31.965
Be careful.

02:08:34.715 --> 02:08:36.257
Break it open!

02:08:58.132 --> 02:08:59.132
Sir!

02:09:00.673 --> 02:09:01.673
Let's go, sir!

02:09:02.548 --> 02:09:03.632
I'm with Mr. Bejoy.

02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:05.340
He's right outside.

02:09:09.715 --> 02:09:10.715
Where are those kids?

02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:12.340
Upstairs.

02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:23.600
Who is this guy?

02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:30.954
Get going!
They're waiting outside!

02:09:31.507 --> 02:09:33.673
Come, Tamizh!
-Come on!

02:09:33.798 --> 02:09:35.680
Come, dear!
-Who is he, sir?

02:09:50.798 --> 02:09:52.257
Another truck out back!
Get in!

02:09:52.382 --> 02:09:54.257
This way!
-Come, Tamizh!

02:09:54.382 --> 02:09:55.882
Go!
-Get going!

02:09:56.007 --> 02:09:57.007
Get going, I say!

02:09:58.048 --> 02:09:59.048
Go, dear!

02:10:00.798 --> 02:10:02.468
A lost life won't come back.

02:10:03.798 --> 02:10:05.048
I'll bring him.
Now go!

02:10:06.090 --> 02:10:08.141
Take her and go, sir!
-Go, dear.

02:10:08.175 --> 02:10:09.425
Don't stop!

02:10:16.947 --> 02:10:19.280
You keep going, kids.
I'll be back.

02:10:19.405 --> 02:10:21.863
Where are you going?
-Go up those stairs. I'll tell you.

02:10:21.887 --> 02:10:23.311
Sir! Sir!...

02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:26.488
Where are you going?
-Take them up. I'll come!

02:10:26.613 --> 02:10:27.655
Come on, sir!

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:30.113
Come here, kid!
Here you go!

02:10:30.238 --> 02:10:31.947
Careful!
-Take him and go! I'll come!

02:10:32.613 --> 02:10:33.613
Sir!

02:10:39.363 --> 02:10:40.988
Look at this!
-Come on, sir.

02:10:41.113 --> 02:10:44.155
This is why those godforsaken mongrels
are creating such a ruckus!

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:46.572
Even if I die,
I won't let them take this!

02:10:46.697 --> 02:10:48.822
I'll burn down this entire thing!

02:10:48.947 --> 02:10:51.447
Let's see even if an ounce remains!
I'll burn it all!

02:10:52.322 --> 02:10:53.613
I'll hit you hard!

02:10:53.738 --> 02:10:56.197
They slit his throat
right before my eyes!

02:10:56.322 --> 02:10:58.863
Poor kid suffered!
He'd be my son's age.

02:10:59.250 --> 02:11:01.062
He died!

02:11:02.738 --> 02:11:05.197
You guys are done for!

02:11:07.905 --> 02:11:10.280
Let's see how
you get your stuff!

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:19.572
Found it?
-See what this is, sir!

02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:31.072
They're drug peddling monsters!

02:11:33.197 --> 02:11:35.905
If they ever get their hands on
what's in here...

02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:38.280
...they'll ruin the lives of students!

02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:41.405
We must not spare them!

02:11:45.572 --> 02:11:46.572
Break it open!

02:12:07.725 --> 02:12:09.572
Hold it tightly. Don't let go.
-Who's this?

02:12:09.697 --> 02:12:10.822
I don't know, brother.

02:12:12.238 --> 02:12:13.655
How does this work?

02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:14.953
Press that red button.

02:12:23.655 --> 02:12:26.344
What's he got?
-Looks like a bug spray machine!

02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:34.030
Come on!

02:12:35.905 --> 02:12:36.905
Now hit it!

02:15:25.696 --> 02:15:27.405
It's nothing.
You're fine!

02:15:28.113 --> 02:15:29.196
Check him out, Vignesh.

02:16:11.155 --> 02:16:13.976
Plenty of cops outside!
What's wrong?

02:16:16.113 --> 02:16:18.030
I'm talking to you!
What happened?

02:16:29.185 --> 02:16:30.349
Sir!

02:16:30.575 --> 02:16:31.560
Dilli!

02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:33.321
Brother?
-Dilli?

02:16:34.071 --> 02:16:35.488
The Sir is here.

02:16:35.613 --> 02:16:36.696
Get down.

02:16:37.988 --> 02:16:39.613
What happened, sir?

02:16:42.613 --> 02:16:44.158
What is it?
-Show me your hands.

02:16:58.696 --> 02:16:59.946
Go.

02:17:00.071 --> 02:17:01.071
What is it, sir?

02:17:01.196 --> 02:17:02.569
Go and see.

02:17:25.738 --> 02:17:26.905
Is that my daughter, sir?

02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:29.780
Come!

02:17:33.905 --> 02:17:35.071
Just come!

02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:40.797
I'm scared!
-Come, dear.

02:17:47.113 --> 02:17:49.071
Go talk to him!
-What do I say, sir?

02:17:49.196 --> 02:17:50.613
Just go!
She'll talk to you.

02:18:26.446 --> 02:18:28.202
Are you my father?

02:18:32.407 --> 02:18:33.751
What's your name?

02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:39.423
Dilli.

02:18:40.007 --> 02:18:41.257
Why are you crying?

02:18:44.757 --> 02:18:45.796
I'm not crying, dear.

02:18:47.548 --> 02:18:50.539
All this while,
why didn't you come and see me?

02:18:58.715 --> 02:19:00.090
Please forgive me, dear!

02:19:09.257 --> 02:19:10.289
Don't cry.

02:19:12.048 --> 02:19:13.273
Don't cry.

02:19:17.968 --> 02:19:18.882
Dad...

02:19:20.298 --> 02:19:21.383
Don't cry, dad!

02:19:23.882 --> 02:19:25.048
My precious!

02:19:29.882 --> 02:19:32.757
You'll never leave me again,
will you, dad?

02:19:32.882 --> 02:19:34.257
I will not, dear!

02:19:34.382 --> 02:19:36.048
I'll never leave you again.

02:19:42.090 --> 02:19:43.590
I won't go anywhere
without you.

02:20:00.798 --> 02:20:01.923
So, Dilli...

02:20:02.048 --> 02:20:03.649
Is she like your dear Viji?

02:20:08.429 --> 02:20:09.492
Sir!

02:20:10.903 --> 02:20:11.786
Sir!

02:20:12.261 --> 02:20:13.544
Hey! Dilli

02:20:14.007 --> 02:20:15.715
Some men will meet you tomorrow.

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:18.507
They'll arrange for everything
you asked for your child.

02:20:20.590 --> 02:20:22.923
I knew you'd do everything
for my child, sir.

02:20:23.923 --> 02:20:24.923
I...

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:34.673
If I give something,
will you accept it?

02:20:35.268 --> 02:20:36.310
What is it?
Give me.

02:20:40.977 --> 02:20:42.310
It's a little broken.

02:20:44.185 --> 02:20:45.265
But pure gold, sir.

02:20:46.185 --> 02:20:47.685
Can you give it to your daughter?

02:20:48.685 --> 02:20:49.685
Alright.

02:20:49.810 --> 02:20:51.634
I'll tell her Uncle Dilli gave it.

02:21:02.227 --> 02:21:04.102
Who is he, sir?

02:21:04.227 --> 02:21:06.727
He wasn't involved with this,
but ruined everything!

02:21:09.810 --> 02:21:11.227
He is involved with it!

02:21:12.018 --> 02:21:13.508
His name is Dilli!
