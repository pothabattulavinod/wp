WEBVTT

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:46.597
They always play the same channel!

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:49.628
They never switch channels!
-That's enough for me!

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:52.204
Don't waste any of it, alright?
-Here.

00:01:52.688 --> 00:01:54.313
Quiet in the back!

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:01.833
Amudha!
-Is this enough or do you want more?

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:03.837
Amudha!

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:07.468
Ma'am?
-Come here.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.587
Leave the plate.
I'll wash it.

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:12.613
Leave it there.
Come here.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.447
Don't play much tonight.

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:16.102
Go to bed soon, alright?

00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:18.298
Why?
-Somebody important is coming...

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:19.754
...to visit you tomorrow.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.962
To visit me?
-Yes.

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:22.087
Who is it, ma'am?

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:24.844
You'll find out when you wake up
tomorrow. Go sleep.

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:27.352
Play carefully!
You may fall down and hurt yourselves!

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:37.337
Sister! If there are no parents,
who else would come to visit me from home?

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:40.337
Besides parents,
many of the uncles come to visit.

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:44.962
And the women they marry. The aunts.
Those kind of people come along.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.629
Forgot to mention it.

00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:50.545
I mentioned everyone.
What if your grandparents are coming?

00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:56.504
When they visit tomorrow,
wear some nice clothes.

00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:58.962
Do you have any?
-Yes, I do.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.670
Loosen your hand.

00:03:52.462 --> 00:03:53.571
Count these, too.
-Alright.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:00.045
Relax.

00:04:10.712 --> 00:04:14.342
Cross-check it and clear the container.
-Alright.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.435
Sir?

00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:21.174
Sir?

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.212
We cracked open a tile.

00:04:23.337 --> 00:04:25.920
100% pure cocaine
was concealed in the tile, sir.

00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:28.045
How many kilograms?
-Almost one ton, sir.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.504
900 kilograms.

00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:31.795
It will definitely be worth
over 800 crores, sir.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920
Undoubtedly the biggest drug bust ever.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.716
Boys!

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.212
I don't know how many lives this drug bust
will claim by sunrise.

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:48.016
Until I get word from Narayanan
or the OPG head, no one must know of this.

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:51.166
That includes your family, too.
-Yes, sir!

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:52.754
Only Thiru's phone stays on.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.670
He must be the only contact person.
-Yes, sir!

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.490
Take no calls except the ones
that come from my number.

00:04:56.515 --> 00:04:57.646
-Yes, sir!
-Ok

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:00.462
Anbu...
Trust me, Anbu!

00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:04.754
I gave the signal
as soon as the vehicle crossed the gate!

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.295
I'm not at fault!
Don't know how the cops got there, Anbu!

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.587
Listen up! My entire cargo's gone!
-I don't know...

00:05:10.712 --> 00:05:14.087
And you've been blubbering repeatedly
like some raving lunatic!

00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:17.004
Ask anyone, Anbu!

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:19.337
Admit it.

00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:21.712
I'll spare you.
-I swear upon my son, Anbu!

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:23.587
Don't know how things went wrong!

00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:24.962
Trust me, Anbu!

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:27.254
I gave the signal as soon as
the vehicle crossed!

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:28.712
Trust me, Anbu!

00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:30.462
Don't do anything to me, Anbu!

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:31.754
I'm not at fault, Anbu!

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.837
Trust me! I gave the signal
as soon as the vehicle crossed!

00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:35.962
Is Anbu there?

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.420
Tell him, brother! You know me, right?
-Anbu.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:41.379
You tell him, brother!
Please!

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:43.754
Talk to him.

00:05:45.254 --> 00:05:46.254
Who is it?

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.110
What gives?
Stumped after giving away all your cocaine?

00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:50.763
Who are you?

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:52.849
I know where your cocaine is.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.295
Adaikalam's younger brother, right?

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.837
I need to speak to your older brother.
Set it up.

00:05:57.962 --> 00:06:00.087
He won't talk.
Tell me if you have a deal in mind.

00:06:00.212 --> 00:06:03.004
Don't know how the cops came, brother!
I swear!

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.329
Please let me go, brother!
I did nothing wrong!

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.212
I'll tell you where your cocaine is.

00:06:08.337 --> 00:06:12.254
To ensure the cops don't interfere,
I'll need twenty kilos of it.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.587
You know how much twenty kilos
is worth in the market?

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:16.587
I don't know
how much twenty kilos is worth.

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:19.254
But I know how much 900 kilos
is worth.

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.462
I can't do this all by myself.

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:26.754
Narcotics Division. Forest Department.
The Inspector General's Office.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.087
All must be handled!

00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:29.379
Plenty of risk at my end!

00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:31.313
A lot of people
must be compensated!

00:06:33.504 --> 00:06:36.087
If twenty kilos is acceptable,
we can talk further.

00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:39.879
Tell him, man!

00:06:40.004 --> 00:06:41.462
Please tell him!

00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:44.295
He gave the signal
when the vehicle crossed, brother!

00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:46.212
Yes, I did!
-Really?

00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:47.337
He gave it, huh?

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.337
Never mind twenty.
Take how much ever you want!

00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:59.129
But I need to know the scumbags
who seized my drugs!

00:06:59.254 --> 00:07:00.629
They must die tonight!

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.629
A cop must consider the consequences
of entering Adaikalam's area!

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.420
So must the entire police force!

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.212
No one near is picking up, Anbu.

00:07:13.337 --> 00:07:14.754
The boss's phone is off, too.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.920
If my brother still hasn't come yet,
something's up.

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:30.195
Has everyone reached
the I.G.'s guesthouse, Paul Pandi?

00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:32.837
Not yet, sir.

00:07:32.962 --> 00:07:35.254
They're tricking in one by one.
Yes, sir.

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:38.670
Do you believe someone can become
a millionaire overnight?

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:40.379
Oh, man!
I get it now, sir!

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:42.295
This is one such night!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.837
If done right,
you're set for life!

00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:47.712
Miss even by an inch,
they'll take you and your family out!

00:07:47.837 --> 00:07:50.420
Watch it.
-Got it, sir. It won't miss.

00:07:51.712 --> 00:07:54.170
What?
-Just a minute.

00:07:58.045 --> 00:07:59.670
What is your problem?

00:07:59.795 --> 00:08:01.754
Don't you get it the first time around?

00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:04.462
Why call repeatedly
and bother me so?

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:08.129
Bejoy.
The squad head.

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:11.170
His squad
has four men.

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:16.045
Thiru, Sudhakar,
Joseph and Kumaran.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:20.379
I'll kill those five men before dawn!

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:22.629
Send me all their details!
Hello?

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.295
Hello?
Still there, sir?

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:28.504
Not just five people you must kill.

00:08:30.212 --> 00:08:32.545
What?
-There is an informant in your gang.

00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:36.545
No chance. Every one of them...
-He's there!

00:08:37.212 --> 00:08:40.295
One of them has been passing information
to Bejoy for two years!

00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:43.962
Why bother the hell out of me like this?

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:46.462
Sir! Sir! Sir!

00:08:46.587 --> 00:08:48.587
Their entire cocaine
amounts to 900 kilos!

00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:50.504
Got any information
about 'Ghost'?

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:52.837
I was saying something.
You're on something else!

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:56.670
Because of the information I gave,
they needlessly killed a man!

00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:59.330
I have trouble breathing!
Scared I'll get busted, sir!

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:01.420
Just listen to me, Ajaz!
-I can't do it anymore!

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:03.837
I'll surrender at the nearest precinct!
-Idiot!

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.420
Is any of this new to you?

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:08.556
You've been undercover
for 26 months!

00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:10.795
Have you ever seen Adaikalam?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.795
Does anyone even know
what he looks like?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.629
They don't, right?
We've seized 900 kilos!

00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:17.712
He must definitely come out
into the open!

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.962
One last chance, Ajaz!

00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:22.212
We've worked for over two years
for this night!

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:24.129
How many cops have died?
-Sir...

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:26.640
Please just hear me out, sir...
-Listen, Ajaz!

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:29.295
Found out who that man is?

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.337
How can that be done
so quickly?

00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:34.504
They must be tracked.
Many must be interrogated.

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:35.879
It's not that easy.

00:09:36.004 --> 00:09:38.420
Can't take any chances
with it. What do you say?

00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:40.879
You're right.
Point out the black sheep to me.

00:09:41.004 --> 00:09:42.224
I'll slit him up!

00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:55.295
Hey! Call and find out
if he's in Shankar's hood.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.087
Sure, brother.
-Spare no one who came in yesterday!

00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:01.045
Get everyone here now!
-Guys have gone out. We'll get him.

00:10:02.087 --> 00:10:03.254
Please understand, sir!

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.420
Please, sir...
-Ajaz!

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:08.254
I must know what's going on there!

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.837
Report to me whenever you can.
That's a bloody order!

00:10:11.134 --> 00:10:12.094
I swear I can't...

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:16.629
I'll call you back, dear.

00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:20.295
Sampath...
-Yes, Anbu?

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.254
There is a cop among us.

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:23.795
Do you suspect anyone?

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.129
No, Anbu.

00:10:26.254 --> 00:10:28.254
There can't be such a thing.
-There is!

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:30.379
He takes my grub
and snitches me out!

00:10:31.962 --> 00:10:35.712
What do we do?
-Call in everyone from our gang tonight.

00:10:35.837 --> 00:10:37.670
I know who the five cops are.

00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:40.254
We must deliver their heads
to the station by tonight!

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:42.118
Alright, I'll take care of it.

00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:44.837
Hey, Chandra!
-Tell me, Sampath!

00:10:44.962 --> 00:10:47.712
Gather around, everyone!
-Wait! Let me stack these up!

00:10:47.837 --> 00:10:49.379
Drop it and come here!

00:10:49.504 --> 00:10:51.087
Need a quick chat!
Come here, guys!

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:56.129
Did a brown container with the number plate
'TN-45 KA-9072' come this way?

00:10:56.254 --> 00:10:57.462
Just a minute.

00:10:57.498 --> 00:10:58.657
Yes! It did, sir!

00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:00.349
When did it cross by?
-7 PM.

00:11:04.545 --> 00:11:07.254
Pull over.

00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.379
Where's the file
of that motel case?

00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:24.629
The Inspector will ask for it
first thing in the morning! Have it up?

00:11:24.754 --> 00:11:26.545
I've filled it up.
Look it over anyway.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.087
Alright, I'll check it up.

00:11:28.212 --> 00:11:29.696
I'll get going, sir.
-Alright.

00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:35.962
Greetings, sir.

00:11:36.087 --> 00:11:39.305
My name is Napoleon. I'm a constable
from the Tirunelveli district.

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:42.251
I need to see Mr. Manickavel.
Just got transferred here.

00:11:42.337 --> 00:11:44.379
Need to know which station
I'm posted...

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:46.629
Oh, you're that guy. He talked about it.
-Yes.

00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:49.670
Why did you come at night?
-Didn't expect it to be this far, sir.

00:11:49.795 --> 00:11:51.629
Should I be on duty
for tomorrow?

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.670
Hey!
Who are you?

00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:55.629
Slapping people
in the police station!

00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:58.295
Is that your sister?
-He guessed right!

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.295
Keep laughing
and I'll break your teeth!

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.670
I'm lenient
because you're just students!

00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:05.337
Sir?
-What is it?

00:12:05.462 --> 00:12:08.212
They're from my college.
Friends of mine.

00:12:08.337 --> 00:12:10.337
Came to pick them up?
-"Pick them up"?

00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:12.837
Is this is a school?
Do you know what they did?

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:16.087
They got drunk and were dancing
to loud music on the railway platform!

00:12:16.212 --> 00:12:18.837
Got a complaint from the control room
and brought them here!

00:12:18.962 --> 00:12:21.587
Sit down. Take it up with the Inspector
when he gets here!

00:12:21.712 --> 00:12:24.861
He knows the Inspector, sir...
-Everyone says that! Sit down!

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.240
Sit in the corner!
-Come, Tamizh!

00:12:29.962 --> 00:12:33.790
Just that it's been two years since
the new Commissioner's office was built.

00:12:33.852 --> 00:12:36.536
The Chief Minister hasn't inaugurated it.
So, it's still closed!

00:12:39.164 --> 00:12:40.062
Sir!

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:41.712
Belongs to those kids, sir!

00:12:41.837 --> 00:12:43.129
Ah, I see.

00:12:43.254 --> 00:12:45.712
The higher-ups have gone
for an urgent meeting.

00:12:45.837 --> 00:12:48.087
It'll be a while for them to get back.
Go have a seat.

00:12:48.212 --> 00:12:49.212
Alright.

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:57.810
Sir! They may assign you to a rural area.
Ask for a posting in the city!

00:12:57.879 --> 00:13:02.089
Money will flow! Even if it's
your last kickback, you'd get plenty!

00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:06.837
Tamizh...

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.170
Tamizh...

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.670
I'm sorry.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.587
It has crossed, sir!

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:19.337
At what time?
-8:30 PM, sir.

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.129
The crossing time at four toll booths
is accurate!

00:13:23.254 --> 00:13:26.587
Only between the fourth and fifth booth,
it took two hours, sir.

00:13:26.712 --> 00:13:27.712
Alright, hang up.

00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:42.545
Good evening, sir.

00:13:44.254 --> 00:13:47.212
What's wrong with your hand, sir?
-Small accident this morning.

00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:51.004
Still on duty or are you off?
-I wrapped up duty and was heading home.

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:54.670
On the way, I saw a constable
from the station yelling at a guy.

00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:56.754
When we asked him,
he had no ID.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:59.754
The guy had a beard and looked suspicious,
sir.

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.920
He wouldn't look me in the eye, sir.

00:14:02.045 --> 00:14:05.212
So, I put him in my jeep. Will question
and release him in the morning, sir.

00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:09.962
Is he handcuffed?
-Yes, sir.

00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:21.004
900 kilos?

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:23.045
How much is it worth in the market?
-Sir...

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:25.712
Approximately 840 crores.

00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:28.504
Any information about that gang?

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:31.170
Adaikalam
and his so-called brother Anbu, sir.

00:14:31.295 --> 00:14:33.795
Under them, there are two more guys:
Tips and Ram.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.379
No one in this entire gang
knows what Adaikalam looks like.

00:14:37.504 --> 00:14:40.920
The master plan of picking a low-key city
like this, turning it into a hub...

00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:44.587
...and flooding the society with drugs,
is all Adaikalam's handiwork.

00:14:44.712 --> 00:14:48.795
In the last two years alone, eleven cops
who worked on this case, were killed.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.587
We know these guys did it.
Yet, we can't do anything.

00:14:51.712 --> 00:14:55.795
What to do, sir? There are many
in our department who work for them.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.504
They are extremely dangerous, sir.

00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:00.609
We've seized not just drugs,
but a lot of explosives, too!

00:15:01.265 --> 00:15:03.962
You won't believe, sir.
They even had a gattling gun!

00:15:04.962 --> 00:15:08.587
Just that the seven guys who were caught
were low level thugs from the gang, sir.

00:15:08.712 --> 00:15:12.071
They handle transportation, supply
and such. They know nothing, sir.

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.420
Let's go.
-That's Rohypnol. A high sedative.

00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:20.920
Don't mix more than five milliliters
in any bottle.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:24.254
Once consumed, it takes fifteen minutes
to take effect.

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:27.314
But one can regain consciousness
only after eight hours!

00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:29.795
Who's the informant?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.533
My boy, sir.
Ajaz Ahmed.

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.379
Tell him to be careful!

00:15:34.004 --> 00:15:36.129
No one knows where the drugs are, right?

00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:38.254
Just you, me and my boys.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.337
Is the Commissioner's office a safe spot?
-No place in the city is safer, sir.

00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:52.379
As the office is an old British building,
there's a secret basement below, sir.

00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:57.004
Until we have it on record,
the evidence we seized will be held there.

00:15:57.129 --> 00:16:01.962
In fact, no one in law and order
even knows that such a place exists, sir!

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:03.650
It's completely safe, sir.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:07.931
Step out.
Go have a drink, guys!

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:14.045
Hey! Their training is almost over.
Just one day, right? Let them go.

00:16:16.337 --> 00:16:17.337
Sir!

00:16:19.504 --> 00:16:23.004
I'll say it again. Don't put more than
five milliliters in any bottle.

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:26.876
Even if it's up by one point,
it can cause death by overdose. Watch it.

00:16:33.504 --> 00:16:34.962
This is a major case.

00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:39.884
Can't pull off a consignment this big,
without political involvement.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.087
For some political reasons...

00:16:43.254 --> 00:16:46.004
...it won't be surprising
if we have to give these back.

00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:47.196
Sir?

00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:48.959
Tell your boys to be safe.

00:16:49.587 --> 00:16:51.129
Nothing about this
must leak out.

00:16:51.962 --> 00:16:55.379
You know what would happen
if all these drugs reach society, sir...

00:16:55.504 --> 00:16:57.837
Hey!
I was speaking hypothetically.

00:16:57.962 --> 00:17:00.337
It is a possibility.
Try to understand.

00:17:00.462 --> 00:17:02.129
Come gulp down two large shots.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:04.170
No, sir.
I'm under medication.

00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:06.610
Alright!
At least give me company!

00:17:16.462 --> 00:17:17.754
Sir!

00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:20.462
What's up?
Everyone's here, right?

00:17:20.587 --> 00:17:22.087
I retire in a month.

00:17:23.004 --> 00:17:26.379
Think they'll get that damn Nagaraj
as my replacement.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.254
Tiruchy's about to witness a new dawn!

00:17:37.129 --> 00:17:39.212
Couldn't hang out with you
at my son's wedding.

00:17:39.337 --> 00:17:42.879
Plenty of protests that time, too.
You guys were busy with it, as well.

00:17:43.004 --> 00:17:45.504
This small party is to celebrate
both these events.

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:50.712
Also, I've recommended eleven people
for promotion.

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:51.837
It will come soon.

00:17:51.962 --> 00:17:55.754
Don't just stand there! Get started!
Enough with the formalities!

00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:58.670
Be sure to inform the station!

00:18:03.462 --> 00:18:06.016
The names of five cops
are in this paper!

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:08.379
The one who brings me
their heads...

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.087
...gets a settlement
of a lifetime!

00:18:12.212 --> 00:18:15.254
All those bloody cops
are at the Inspector General's guest house!

00:18:15.379 --> 00:18:16.920
Their deaths will make...

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:19.504
...any cop who even thinks
of messing with us...

00:18:19.629 --> 00:18:20.712
...shiver in fear!

00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:23.045
This is an open challenge!
Take it on if you dare!

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.129
Cheers!

00:18:54.462 --> 00:18:56.254
Don't be shy! Just have it.
-No thanks.

00:19:05.004 --> 00:19:06.004
Cheers!

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.420
Cheers!

00:19:20.795 --> 00:19:22.045
Excuse me.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.129
All going perfectly, sir!
They've started drinking.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920
I'll call back, sir.

00:19:36.337 --> 00:19:38.254
Confirmed that this is where
the stuff is?

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:42.087
Take half of our guys
and get going.

00:19:43.795 --> 00:19:45.657
I'll clear out the rest of the stuff...

00:19:46.795 --> 00:19:48.879
...and track down the place
where the boss is.

00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:51.633
We can reclaim the cargo
before he gets back.

00:19:56.754 --> 00:19:57.754
Let's go.

00:20:04.587 --> 00:20:05.712
Anbu!

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.670
The guys are ready!
You didn't tell us where the stuff is.

00:20:43.462 --> 00:20:45.295
Sir!

00:20:46.504 --> 00:20:49.545
What happened, Joseph?
-Sir!

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.254
Sir...
-Move aside!

00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:58.087
Don't do it, sir!
-Hold him off, sir!

00:20:58.744 --> 00:21:00.562
What happened?
-Look there!

00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:02.295
Someone's driving away
in the jeep, sir!

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.129
Stop!

00:21:07.754 --> 00:21:09.415
Look up, sir!
-Are you okay?

00:21:13.337 --> 00:21:14.515
Somebody catch him!

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.205
Sir!

00:21:22.295 --> 00:21:23.337
Sir!

00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:24.504
What?
-Come look, sir!

00:21:24.629 --> 00:21:26.379
Where's the I.G.?
-He passed out, sir!

00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:28.185
Sir...Sir..

00:21:31.879 --> 00:21:33.004
What happened, sir?

00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:36.045
You're bleeding! They drugged
our drinks or our water, sir!

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.337
Commissioner's office is under attack!
It's a trap! What do we do, sir?

00:21:39.462 --> 00:21:41.504
Folks from law and order, and crime
are here, yes?

00:21:41.629 --> 00:21:44.462
Shall I inform the railway police
and CB-CID, sir?

00:21:44.587 --> 00:21:47.670
Don't!
Let no one know about this.

00:21:47.795 --> 00:21:52.504
We can lose the drugs.
But not a single cop must lose his life!

00:21:52.629 --> 00:21:56.379
If the media finds out,
it'll embarrass the entire department!

00:21:56.504 --> 00:21:57.920
Do something!

00:21:58.045 --> 00:22:00.962
I wanted to retire with dignity.

00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:03.004
I must have that!
Please do something!

00:22:03.129 --> 00:22:05.337
Please!
-Is any one out there?

00:22:06.004 --> 00:22:07.004
Hey!

00:22:08.212 --> 00:22:10.837
No one eat or drink anything!
Throw away everything!

00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:12.837
Alright, sir!
-What do we do with them?

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.420
Hold on.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.879
Patience.
Be careful!

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.170
Hold on!

00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:25.795
Hey, Kamatchi!

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.712
Whose truck is this?
-Our truck, sir.

00:22:27.837 --> 00:22:29.587
Catering truck.
-Where's the driver?

00:22:29.712 --> 00:22:33.129
As he only had to drive tomorrow,
he boozed and ended up like these guys!

00:22:33.254 --> 00:22:34.962
Do you drive?
-Can't drive a truck, sir!

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.879
You?
-I can only ride two-wheelers.

00:22:37.004 --> 00:22:39.004
And you?
-I don't know how to drive a truck, sir.

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:40.795
Check if there's anyone in the back!

00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:44.920
What happened to them, sir?
-It doesn't concern you.

00:22:45.045 --> 00:22:46.545
Just do what you're told. Now go!

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.629
No one here either, sir!

00:22:58.295 --> 00:23:00.670
The guy had a beard and looked suspicious,
sir.

00:23:01.587 --> 00:23:03.629
He wouldn't look me in the eye, sir.

00:23:03.754 --> 00:23:06.920
So, I put him in my jeep. Will question
and release him in the morning, sir.

00:23:16.254 --> 00:23:18.087
Hey!
Do you know how to drive?

00:23:19.212 --> 00:23:20.295
Hey! I'm talking to you!

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.170
Can you drive a truck?

00:23:23.295 --> 00:23:24.587
Are you deaf?

00:23:24.712 --> 00:23:26.587
Hey!
Do you hear me or not?

00:23:28.837 --> 00:23:31.110
Hey!
Do you know to drive or not?

00:23:33.837 --> 00:23:34.732
Okay...

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920
Step out.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.295
Go start that truck up!

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.962
The Commissioner's office
is 80 kilometers away.

00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:23.337
Drop me there and take off.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.564
I'll see to it there's no case
against you. Go it? Go!

00:24:29.212 --> 00:24:30.545
What?

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.712
Can't do it.

00:24:32.254 --> 00:24:33.712
You said you knew how to drive.

00:24:33.837 --> 00:24:34.837
I did say that.

00:24:35.712 --> 00:24:37.462
Never said I would do it.

00:24:37.587 --> 00:24:40.795
What the hell, man? You raise your voice
after I took off your cuffs?

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.337
How could I not, sir?

00:24:42.462 --> 00:24:43.837
Is it a crime
to have a beard?

00:24:43.962 --> 00:24:46.504
Your guy roughly pulled
at my brand new shirt!

00:24:46.629 --> 00:24:48.045
It got torn, too!

00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:52.795
If someone from the government says so,
your guy said he'd let me go.

00:24:53.462 --> 00:24:55.268
Here. Talk to her.

00:24:56.581 --> 00:24:57.044
Hello!

00:24:57.045 --> 00:24:58.879
Hey Dilli!
Got into the bus?

00:24:59.004 --> 00:25:01.004
I'm not Dilli.
I'm Bejoy.

00:25:01.129 --> 00:25:02.587
Special Task Force.

00:25:02.712 --> 00:25:03.712
Who's he to you?

00:25:03.837 --> 00:25:07.127
I'm Nalini.
Probation officer. Puzhal Jail.

00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:10.587
Is he a convict?
-He was.

00:25:10.712 --> 00:25:11.751
Not anymore.

00:25:12.212 --> 00:25:14.004
He was serving a life sentence.

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:16.170
Four years were cut off
by remission.

00:25:16.295 --> 00:25:19.462
He served ten years in prison
and was just released today.

00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:22.319
He has a release order with him.
Didn't you see it?

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:25.379
Convicts shouldn't have beards.
How is this, ma'am?

00:25:25.504 --> 00:25:27.670
Special petition, sir.
For a pilgrimage!

00:25:27.795 --> 00:25:29.587
First tell me your problem!

00:25:29.712 --> 00:25:31.379
An emergency here, ma'am!

00:25:31.504 --> 00:25:34.212
A truck must be driven for 80 kilometers.
No one else here.

00:25:34.337 --> 00:25:37.879
I asked him to drive and he refuses.
You're a G.O., right? Tell him!

00:25:38.004 --> 00:25:40.629
Why must Dilli drive the truck?
He won't do it!

00:25:40.754 --> 00:25:42.004
Let him go!

00:25:42.129 --> 00:25:44.688
Please listen to me, ma'am...
-Sir!

00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:47.379
Listen carefully to what I say.

00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:50.170
He hasn't seen his child in ten years.

00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:56.754
After so long, we just got to know
that she's at an ashram in Perambalur.

00:25:56.879 --> 00:26:00.423
Tomorrow morning, he's going to meet
his daughter for the first time.

00:26:00.962 --> 00:26:03.587
Why do you drag him
into your mess, sir?

00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:04.879
Ma'am...

00:26:05.004 --> 00:26:07.087
Every convict has a justification.

00:26:07.212 --> 00:26:08.962
But this is a serious situation!

00:26:09.087 --> 00:26:10.879
Involves the lives of many cops!

00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:12.665
Please tell him to drive!

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.670
Talk to her.

00:26:18.545 --> 00:26:19.879
Hello?
-Dilli...

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.844
Listen to what that cop wants and help...
-Ma'am...

00:26:24.629 --> 00:26:25.798
I can't do it, ma'am.

00:26:26.962 --> 00:26:28.985
The life I lost
has just begun again.

00:26:30.337 --> 00:26:31.879
Please don't compel me, ma'am.

00:26:33.837 --> 00:26:36.509
I'll call you after I get on the bus.
-No, Dilli...

00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:40.545
I'll ask you for the last time.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.129
Will you drive or not?

00:26:42.254 --> 00:26:44.420
Un-cuff me, sir.
I must get going.

00:26:45.879 --> 00:26:47.087
I'm screaming my head off!

00:26:47.629 --> 00:26:50.045
It's that release order in your pocket,
right? Look here!

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.384
Get charged with even a petty crime
in the next 3 years, it'll be nixed!

00:26:53.493 --> 00:26:55.170
You'll be sent back to jail!
Know it, right?

00:26:56.837 --> 00:26:58.295
I know where your child is.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.670
One phone call's enough.

00:26:59.795 --> 00:27:02.795
I can have her transferred to another home
overnight!

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.504
It'll take you ten years to even find out
where she is! Shall I do it?

00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:08.087
Or will you start the truck?

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.587
Thought you'd let me go
if I told the truth.

00:27:14.212 --> 00:27:16.004
You had to play the cop game!
-Why not?

00:27:16.129 --> 00:27:19.754
Like only you have a family!
Do you only consider yourself to be human?

00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:21.379
Don't cops have families, too?

00:27:21.504 --> 00:27:23.629
This is night!
Cops aren't on the beat tonight!

00:27:23.754 --> 00:27:26.920
Read in tomorrow's paper of the crimes
that go down tonight! You'll get it!

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:29.009
Cops on duty
were drinking.

00:27:30.212 --> 00:27:33.170
Will the news also report that a convict
dropped them at the precinct?

00:27:33.297 --> 00:27:35.321
Do you want to see your daughter or not?

00:27:48.193 --> 00:27:51.985
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:56.024
Sister?
-What is it?

00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:59.930
How many more hours left
until ten o'clock in the morning?

00:28:00.485 --> 00:28:03.110
First, put away the clock
and go to sleep.

00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:05.681
If Ma'am comes for rounds,
you'll get in trouble!

00:28:46.776 --> 00:28:49.193
Hey! Do you know how to drive a truck
or not?

00:29:07.068 --> 00:29:08.068
Oh God!

00:29:12.776 --> 00:29:14.474
What's wrong?
-Sir...

00:29:14.901 --> 00:29:16.776
It doesn't brake properly.

00:29:16.901 --> 00:29:19.818
All four wheels are shaking.
Third gear isn't working right.

00:29:19.943 --> 00:29:22.458
Don't know if it can go 80 kilometers, sir.
-Sir!...

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.610
I swear to God the truck just got insured
and was issued a safety certificate!

00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:28.401
This guy doesn't know how to drive!
It's in great shape, sir!

00:29:28.526 --> 00:29:30.485
Do we drive around
without knowing all this?

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.901
Go ask what's up!
-Who are you?

00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:34.974
Look at the board.
I'm the Kamatchi mentioned there!

00:29:35.019 --> 00:29:36.681
I own this truck!
-Fine!

00:29:36.727 --> 00:29:39.629
Don't do anything unless I say so.
Go stand there!

00:29:40.098 --> 00:29:43.060
Carefully carry each officer
into the truck.

00:29:43.802 --> 00:29:47.312
Listen up. No matter what,
don't tell anyone what happened here.

00:29:47.437 --> 00:29:51.020
If you do, I'll arrest you
and your entire family!

00:29:51.266 --> 00:29:52.831
Alright.
-Go help with this.

00:29:57.113 --> 00:29:58.488
Let's go!

00:29:58.676 --> 00:29:59.594
Go inside!

00:30:02.232 --> 00:30:04.240
Lift them up slowly.

00:30:13.423 --> 00:30:16.478
Come along!
All convicts stand in line!

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.436
Stand in line, I say!

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.834
What kind of reaction did they have,
Bejoy?

00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:46.376
Both pulse and heartbeat
are elevated, doctor.

00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:48.334
Some of them even vomitted blood.

00:30:48.459 --> 00:30:50.917
Bleeding from the ears, too.
I'm a little scared.

00:30:51.042 --> 00:30:52.251
Alright, listen.

00:30:52.376 --> 00:30:54.209
You're aware of sedative drugs, right?

00:30:54.816 --> 00:30:58.941
Brotizolam, Midazolum,
Ketamine and Rohypnol.

00:30:59.403 --> 00:31:03.068
If any of these is mixed with alcohol,
there'd be this type of reaction.

00:31:03.477 --> 00:31:07.602
If treated within five hours,
they can be saved, Bejoy.

00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:10.856
If not, it'll be very difficult.

00:31:10.981 --> 00:31:12.856
There are chances of cardiac arrest.

00:31:12.981 --> 00:31:15.231
I can't come by the highway.

00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:17.314
And no one must know about this incident.

00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:19.023
It's a bit complicated to explain.

00:31:19.648 --> 00:31:22.314
Send me the location. I'll get there soon.
-Hurry.

00:31:24.021 --> 00:31:27.396
Vignesh! Keep my bag inside
and see how many beds are available.

00:31:27.656 --> 00:31:28.698
We may need extra beds.

00:31:29.703 --> 00:31:31.364
Hold the legs! Uncle

00:31:32.994 --> 00:31:35.323
That's it. Just let them lie.
-Go!

00:31:56.105 --> 00:31:59.147
Place them like that and it won't hold!
Lay them down! Come, uncle!

00:32:00.355 --> 00:32:01.772
Just a minute, sir!

00:32:01.897 --> 00:32:03.605
How do I turn this crap off?

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.605
Press the first button!

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.050
Not the second. The first!
That's it!

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.527
Hello! Tell me, sir.

00:32:10.552 --> 00:32:13.273
Muthu! How many of you are on duty
at the Commissioner's office?

00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:15.659
Me and three other constables
on night duty.

00:32:15.732 --> 00:32:16.774
And in the office?

00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:18.776
Everyone in the office has left!

00:32:18.922 --> 00:32:21.922
Besides the convicts in lock-up,
is there anyone else there?

00:32:22.047 --> 00:32:24.588
Four students
on a drunken diving charge, sir.

00:32:24.713 --> 00:32:26.297
Alert the other stations.

00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:28.880
Bring all constables to where you're at.
I'm on my way!

00:32:29.005 --> 00:32:30.880
Listen carefully.

00:32:31.005 --> 00:32:34.130
Have the constables
shut every door in our station. Got it?

00:32:34.255 --> 00:32:36.880
I understand.
But why are we doing this, sir?

00:32:37.005 --> 00:32:39.797
Stop asking questions
and do what I say. Quick!

00:32:39.922 --> 00:32:41.130
Alert everyone, alright?

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.755
Hoist them in!

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:51.963
I said 'hoist', not 'drop'!

00:32:52.088 --> 00:32:53.963
My arm got stuck!

00:32:54.088 --> 00:32:56.630
Hold this!
-Quit talking! Now lift! Hurry!

00:32:57.672 --> 00:32:59.255
Lift them up!

00:33:00.255 --> 00:33:01.838
Samayapuram police station?

00:33:01.963 --> 00:33:04.130
I'm calling from
the Commissioner's office.

00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:06.005
Inspector there?
-Mr. Murali there?

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.797
He's not here.
-S.I. there?

00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:10.213
He left a while back.
-No officials at the station.

00:33:10.338 --> 00:33:12.297
Give me his mobile number.
-98...

00:33:12.422 --> 00:33:13.963
He's not reachable on his cell.

00:33:14.088 --> 00:33:16.922
Got a message saying 'I.G. Guesthouse'.
-Is that what he said?

00:33:17.047 --> 00:33:18.422
Don't know anything else.

00:33:18.547 --> 00:33:22.255
How many of you are there?
-Just me and another police constable.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.797
If he comes, tell him to call back.
-Will do.

00:33:24.922 --> 00:33:27.297
Ask them why they're hauling
so many people, uncle!

00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:28.668
You just keep loading them in!

00:33:29.088 --> 00:33:31.213
Poor chaps!
-Will you carry vessels on your head?

00:33:31.338 --> 00:33:32.914
At least you tell him, aunty!

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.047
Do whatever you want!
-Listen. Now, we're here.

00:33:36.172 --> 00:33:38.338
This is where we must go.
About 80 kilometers.

00:33:38.463 --> 00:33:40.088
Can't take the Poondi Highway.

00:33:40.213 --> 00:33:43.626
Take a shortcut to Thavakudi
and drop them off at the hospital.

00:33:43.657 --> 00:33:45.880
Then, to the Commissioner's office.
-Know the route?

00:33:46.005 --> 00:33:48.016
Tell me as we go along.
-We need the map.

00:33:49.088 --> 00:33:51.297
All done!
-Any locals here?

00:33:51.422 --> 00:33:53.047
Any other route
to Pazhani?

00:33:53.172 --> 00:33:56.380
There's no route I don't know.
Even Google Maps doesn't know them!

00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:59.583
There's a roundabout shortcut. That fine?
-Know the route?

00:33:59.608 --> 00:34:02.197
From Madhavaram into Devancheri,
Ayampettai, Thittakudi...

00:34:02.231 --> 00:34:04.231
Can a truck go through?
-"Can it go through"?

00:34:04.356 --> 00:34:06.564
Only my truck goes there!
Two checkposts en route.

00:34:06.689 --> 00:34:08.356
If you pay off your guys there...

00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:10.147
They'll let us through.

00:34:10.272 --> 00:34:11.622
Bring him, too.
-What?

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.189
Can't drive without directions.

00:34:13.814 --> 00:34:15.939
Hey! Get inside the truck.
-Sir?

00:34:16.064 --> 00:34:17.189
Come!
-What the hell, sir?

00:34:17.314 --> 00:34:18.314
Come!
-Why must I?

00:34:18.439 --> 00:34:19.689
Look at this, uncle!

00:34:19.814 --> 00:34:21.689
You hauled these guys
without my consent!

00:34:21.814 --> 00:34:25.814
If you coolly take my truck,
how do we all go home with our stuff?

00:34:25.939 --> 00:34:27.397
Pay me first, sir!
-Hey!

00:34:27.522 --> 00:34:29.064
Think I'm asking for permission?

00:34:29.189 --> 00:34:31.891
40 cops are unconscious!
What did you put in the food?

00:34:32.018 --> 00:34:33.476
I'll arrest you both!

00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:34.893
You can't do business!

00:34:35.018 --> 00:34:36.435
Now get in!
-No, sir...

00:34:39.768 --> 00:34:43.810
That guy casually had ton of biryani
and sits hale and hearty in there, sir!

00:34:43.935 --> 00:34:45.810
How come he alone is fine?

00:34:45.935 --> 00:34:48.630
Do you know how famous Kamatchi Biryani
is in Tiruchy, sir?

00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:53.661
Yes, dear. Only if you go,
will our truck be safe.

00:34:53.696 --> 00:34:54.868
Get lost!

00:35:04.321 --> 00:35:05.321
Let's go.

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:19.071
I called every station.
They told us exactly what they told you!

00:35:19.196 --> 00:35:21.612
No officials in any station.
Just constables.

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:25.154
We'll shut all the doors, sir.

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:27.487
Four of us are here.
We'll manage, sir!

00:35:27.612 --> 00:35:30.987
And if we shut the doors?
Don't know how many of them are coming.

00:35:31.112 --> 00:35:33.196
How many people can we fight
with just batons?

00:35:33.321 --> 00:35:34.571
Sir...

00:35:34.696 --> 00:35:37.487
They asked only us to handle it.
That's why I'm worried.

00:35:37.612 --> 00:35:39.362
So we're the sacrificial lambs?

00:35:39.487 --> 00:35:41.237
I got only five more months of work left.

00:35:41.362 --> 00:35:44.029
Don't want to get banged up
and be crippled in my last days!

00:35:44.154 --> 00:35:47.237
That's not it. If there's an inquiry,
we'll be the ones questioned.

00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:50.029
Who said so?
They'll start from the higher-ups.

00:35:50.704 --> 00:35:51.954
Let them deal with it!

00:35:52.654 --> 00:35:53.987
Have you all forgotten?

00:35:54.112 --> 00:35:57.821
When three cops at the Kajarpet station
died during night duty...

00:35:57.946 --> 00:36:00.446
...no higher officials answered the phone
then, too!

00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:02.779
Let's focus on leaving here alive.

00:36:02.904 --> 00:36:04.696
Whatever it is, let the night pass.

00:36:04.821 --> 00:36:07.279
That girl and four boys
are in there, sir.

00:36:07.404 --> 00:36:09.029
Shall we let them go?

00:36:09.154 --> 00:36:12.987
Hey! If you go say something,
you might be busted in the inquiry!

00:36:13.112 --> 00:36:15.154
What is fated to happen will happen.
Come!

00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:39.946
Take this left.

00:36:41.446 --> 00:36:43.636
No, wait!
The next left!

00:36:54.321 --> 00:36:56.430
No... think it was the previous left.

00:37:00.154 --> 00:37:01.196
Hey, kiddo...

00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:04.154
Do you hink this is a moped
where one can turn as they please?

00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:06.654
Can't you direct me properly?
-I can only tell like this!

00:37:06.779 --> 00:37:08.237
Take it or find the way yourself!

00:37:08.362 --> 00:37:09.946
He's scolding me, sir!

00:37:10.071 --> 00:37:11.987
This'll confuse me
and I'll forget the route!

00:37:12.112 --> 00:37:13.946
Like you pay me for this!

00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:15.987
Threaten me
as if you pay my salary!

00:37:16.112 --> 00:37:18.404
I pay salaries to many people
every month, you know!

00:37:18.529 --> 00:37:20.226
Tell him to drive quietly, sir!

00:37:40.654 --> 00:37:41.793
Pandi?
-Sir?

00:37:41.818 --> 00:37:43.946
If our guys get there,
point those men out.

00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:45.154
They'll handle...
-No!

00:37:45.279 --> 00:37:49.112
Some random guy picked up all the cops
and is driving them somewhere in a truck!

00:37:49.237 --> 00:37:50.571
Going where?
-I don't know!

00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:53.071
You were there, sir?
Couldn't you do anything?

00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:55.362
I can't do anything, sir!
Bejoy's here, too!

00:37:55.487 --> 00:37:56.487
Okay, hang up.

00:37:56.612 --> 00:37:58.696
I'll call in five minutes
and tell you what to do.

00:37:58.821 --> 00:37:59.821
Alright, sir.

00:38:07.487 --> 00:38:08.487
Hold on.

00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:15.034
No one's around, buddy.
That phone's been ringing for a while.

00:38:20.259 --> 00:38:21.633
They've all left.

00:38:24.675 --> 00:38:26.592
Shall we all just escape, bro?

00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:28.217
Hey!
-Just sit quietly!

00:38:28.342 --> 00:38:30.800
Buzz off!
Incessantly bothering me...

00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:32.300
Hey!
-Tell me!

00:38:32.425 --> 00:38:33.634
Where are you going?

00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:35.009
Tell him to be quiet, Chittu!

00:38:35.134 --> 00:38:37.300
They took us along, Tamizh!
-Be silent!

00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:39.275
Why drink again?
-Shall we booze?

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.509
The Inspector'll come soon...
-Quiet!

00:38:41.634 --> 00:38:42.759
Don't make trouble!

00:38:42.884 --> 00:38:45.079
Blue shirt!
Do you hear me?

00:38:45.977 --> 00:38:47.173
No cops around?

00:38:48.594 --> 00:38:50.634
Yes, there's no one here.

00:38:50.759 --> 00:38:52.938
Just come up for a minute!

00:38:53.634 --> 00:38:54.967
I won't do anything.

00:38:55.092 --> 00:38:58.175
There's a key over here.
Just get it to us.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.842
Don't go!
-Come!

00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:01.384
Don't go there!
-Please help!

00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:02.967
Don't be scared!
-Hey!

00:39:03.092 --> 00:39:05.550
Just get it to us.
-Don't go!

00:39:05.675 --> 00:39:07.217
Come!
-Where are you going?

00:39:07.342 --> 00:39:08.884
That guy called me from up there.

00:39:09.009 --> 00:39:11.259
You should not go near suspects!
Come!

00:39:11.384 --> 00:39:12.842
Where are the other cops?

00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:14.842
We don't know anything.
They left.

00:39:14.967 --> 00:39:16.384
No one's been here for a while.

00:39:16.509 --> 00:39:18.467
How can they leave
during duty hours?

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:20.175
Move aside.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.717
Why are you people here?

00:39:25.842 --> 00:39:27.550
We're engineering students...
-Stop!

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:29.342
We got busted for drunken driving.

00:39:29.388 --> 00:39:32.162
The Inspector has our licenses,
cell phones and college IDs.

00:39:32.217 --> 00:39:34.154
We can't leave until he returns.
-Move.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.800
Hello?
-Alerted the other stations, Muthu?

00:39:42.925 --> 00:39:45.634
Who is this?
-Bejoy speaking! Special Task Force!

00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:47.009
Sir!

00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:48.550
There's no one at the station!

00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:50.592
Head constable was there,
but even he left!

00:39:50.717 --> 00:39:52.675
There are no cops around?
What the hell...

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.050
Who are you?
-I'm Napoleon, sir!

00:39:56.175 --> 00:39:59.717
I got transferred here from Tirunelveli.
Haven't joined duty here yet!

00:39:59.842 --> 00:40:01.134
How old are you?

00:40:01.259 --> 00:40:03.384
I turn 55
in the coming 'Puratasi' month!

00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:05.092
Alright, then.

00:40:05.217 --> 00:40:07.050
Your service has commenced.
Got it?

00:40:07.175 --> 00:40:08.550
I don't get it!

00:40:08.675 --> 00:40:12.634
From now on, your posting
is at the Commissioner's office!

00:40:12.759 --> 00:40:13.962
Got it?
-Yes, sir!

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.217
There's an emergency. On my way there now!
I'll reach in two hours!

00:40:17.342 --> 00:40:20.009
Until then,
no one gets into the Commissioner's office!

00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:21.925
Lock all the doors and windows!
-Got it!

00:40:22.029 --> 00:40:24.592
Shut all the gates right away! Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:56.759
Eyes on the road. Next right turn.
I'm not sure about that, too.

00:41:05.009 --> 00:41:08.384
Mustn't I give directions all night?
Tonight, what I say is the route. Go!

00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:11.342
Hey!

00:41:12.217 --> 00:41:14.550
Know what that man will do to you...

00:41:14.675 --> 00:41:17.675
...if I say I'm feeling giddy
after eating the biryani you made?

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.300
Will you tell the route properly, now?
-Yes, bro.

00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:27.884
This right.
Correct route.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.509
Who do I speak to?

00:41:34.634 --> 00:41:36.842
I'll give you the number
of a guy named Tips.

00:41:36.967 --> 00:41:39.584
Tell him the route.
-I'll call him right away!

00:41:43.967 --> 00:41:47.050
Cleared the stuff from the upper level!
-Have them clear out soon!

00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:49.759
Hello?
-Tips?

00:41:49.884 --> 00:41:51.967
I'm the guy Mr. Stephen told you about.
-Go on.

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:55.384
The truck's going by Madhavaram.
Don't know where it's headed.

00:41:55.509 --> 00:41:57.800
They're taking a right
into Devancheri!

00:41:57.925 --> 00:41:59.509
Keep giving me the directions.

00:41:59.634 --> 00:42:01.675
I'll handle it.
-Will do!

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.342
Hey!
The truck is not at the I.G.'s guesthouse.

00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:08.175
They're carrying all of them
and going via Madhavaram.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.175
They'll have to cross the hill.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.967
Split up into teams and go.

00:42:12.092 --> 00:42:14.550
If they escape from any one of you,
the other will get them!

00:42:29.092 --> 00:42:32.050
He's not even a cop, bro!
I think he's just a watchman!

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.259
Sir!
-What happened, Napoleon?

00:42:39.384 --> 00:42:41.217
All the doors are shut, sir!

00:42:41.342 --> 00:42:44.884
Including the main door.
But they need reinforcement from inside!

00:42:45.009 --> 00:42:46.509
Then do it!
I'm on my way there!

00:42:46.634 --> 00:42:47.967
Can't do it on my own, sir.

00:42:48.092 --> 00:42:50.925
Sir!
Why did you lock all the doors, sir?

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.550
First, let us go!
-Wait!

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:55.592
Who's that?
-The girl who came with the college kids.

00:42:55.717 --> 00:42:57.675
Shall I let them go?
-Don't do that.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.634
No one leaves until I get there.
Take all their phones.

00:43:00.759 --> 00:43:02.300
Alright, sir.
Give me that phone.

00:43:02.425 --> 00:43:05.509
Why, sir?
-I'll return it soon! Just give it.

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:09.675
Have those kids help you lock up. Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.384
Each of you give me a hand.

00:43:11.509 --> 00:43:13.800
Use these benches and chairs
to block the doors!

00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:16.384
Come along!
-Why should we do all this, sir?

00:43:16.509 --> 00:43:18.701
You took our phones
and won't let us go!

00:43:18.726 --> 00:43:21.592
Return it! I need to call the Inspector!
-Hold on! I'll return it!

00:43:21.717 --> 00:43:23.884
We can only help
if you tell us what's going on!

00:43:24.009 --> 00:43:26.467
I myself don't know!
Let the higher official arrive!

00:43:26.592 --> 00:43:27.592
He'll explain!

00:43:27.717 --> 00:43:31.240
We'll help out. Just don't charge
any of us for drunken driving!

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:32.717
What?
-I'll handle it.

00:43:32.842 --> 00:43:35.009
Forget that, sir!
They drunk and drove.

00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:36.842
I just accompanied them!
-Is that so?

00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:39.092
Sir! Don't charge us...
-Shut up!

00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:40.550
I'll give you an earful!

00:43:40.675 --> 00:43:43.009
He's struggling so much by himself!
Got no sense?

00:43:43.967 --> 00:43:46.342
I'll stay until the other cops come!
Leave if you wish!

00:43:46.467 --> 00:43:48.175
I'll come help, sir!
-Come along!

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.557
Give me a hand with that bench.

00:43:52.134 --> 00:43:53.342
Push harder!

00:43:56.217 --> 00:43:57.168
Come!

00:43:58.925 --> 00:44:00.134
Keep pushing!

00:44:13.967 --> 00:44:15.467
Crossing Vannadu!
Yes!

00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:18.384
Confirmed?
-Indeed!

00:44:18.509 --> 00:44:20.050
Moongilthottam!
I saw the board!

00:44:21.717 --> 00:44:24.884
The guys are coming.
Just point out those five cops!

00:44:24.977 --> 00:44:26.821
Alright.
-They'll handle the rest.

00:44:37.092 --> 00:44:38.134
Help lift this!

00:44:44.425 --> 00:44:46.050
There's a door there.
-Yes, sir.

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:47.717
Over there!

00:44:50.175 --> 00:44:51.759
Haul it in!
-Lift it carefully!

00:44:51.884 --> 00:44:53.550
Hey!
-What is it?

00:44:53.675 --> 00:44:55.384
The booze, you idiot!
-Alright, jerk!

00:44:55.509 --> 00:44:56.509
Go!

00:45:21.425 --> 00:45:22.425
All ready over there?

00:45:23.467 --> 00:45:25.259
Yes, Tips.
-The truck's on the way.

00:45:25.384 --> 00:45:28.467
Hack up those five right there
and bring me their heads!

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:30.384
Got it?
-I'll call you once it's done.

00:45:34.425 --> 00:45:35.425
Hey!

00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:39.891
What is that noise?
-Is this the time to play with the alarm?

00:45:40.884 --> 00:45:43.384
Turn it off, Amudha!
-That damn thing keeps making noise!

00:45:43.509 --> 00:45:44.967
What do you want now?

00:45:45.092 --> 00:45:47.259
Want to know who's visiting you
in the morning?

00:45:48.884 --> 00:45:49.884
The number register.

00:45:54.009 --> 00:45:56.967
Radio's down, too. How do we go
so far without listening to music?

00:45:57.884 --> 00:45:59.842
Do you have a phone, bro?

00:45:59.967 --> 00:46:02.009
How would you have one?

00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:04.759
Just got released today, right?
Like a new movie!

00:46:04.884 --> 00:46:06.467
How many years were you in jail?

00:46:07.842 --> 00:46:09.300
Ten years.
-Wow!

00:46:11.467 --> 00:46:12.759
2009!

00:46:12.884 --> 00:46:14.717
I was in eighth grade back then!

00:46:14.842 --> 00:46:17.175
Since you went to prison,
quite a lot has changed!

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.300
They said they'll change the nation.
But no major changes yet.

00:46:20.425 --> 00:46:22.675
We only voted once,
but...

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.967
If you're not on WhatsApp,
you're not alive!

00:46:25.092 --> 00:46:27.384
Ajith and Rajnikanth's films
released on the same day!

00:46:27.509 --> 00:46:30.050
Nowadays,
films run only if they have a good story!

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.009
Hell, now we save the cops
who've been saving us so far!

00:46:35.134 --> 00:46:36.884
Many such things have changed!

00:46:37.009 --> 00:46:40.978
Poor guy!
Seem like a fish out of water, right?

00:46:41.345 --> 00:46:43.842
Keep going.
You'll prefer prison to this!

00:46:46.592 --> 00:46:47.842
Hey!

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:49.717
You think prison is in the planet Mars?

00:46:50.717 --> 00:46:52.592
Only a wall separates us!

00:46:54.009 --> 00:46:56.425
There's a folder with Yesudas songs
in it. Play them.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.467
Figured when I saw the ash
on your forehead!

00:46:59.634 --> 00:47:02.675
Used whatever was available
and blocked all the doors, sir!

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.550
No one can break in easily!

00:47:04.675 --> 00:47:07.092
Unlike what you said,
no one's come about, sir.

00:47:07.217 --> 00:47:08.925
Alright.
Listen up.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:10.467
Turn off all the lights.
-Okay.

00:47:10.592 --> 00:47:11.967
I'm on my way.
-Yes, sir.

00:47:12.092 --> 00:47:14.592
Don't be scared, alright?
-Yes, sir. Please come!

00:47:16.675 --> 00:47:18.888
Hurry up!
-Sir!

00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:22.717
No diesel left.
Don't know when the vehicle will stop.

00:47:22.842 --> 00:47:24.300
I'll tell you.
Now drive!

00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:26.134
How will the vehicle go
if you say so?

00:47:26.259 --> 00:47:27.842
(A Yesudas song plays on the phone)

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.259
My dad took care of the catering company.

00:47:49.384 --> 00:47:52.675
After he died,
I run the business along with my uncle.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.592
Others use sub-standard rice
for biryani.

00:47:55.717 --> 00:47:58.550
We use the best kind!
Our brand stands for quality!

00:47:59.384 --> 00:48:00.800
How was the biryani?

00:48:00.925 --> 00:48:03.009
Right! You would've had slop
for years!

00:48:03.134 --> 00:48:05.509
Even plain rice would seem like biryani
to you, yes?

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.550
A call's coming in for you!

00:48:11.509 --> 00:48:13.092
I have no one to call me.

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:17.467
No one's picking up.

00:48:17.592 --> 00:48:19.092
Try calling again.

00:48:19.217 --> 00:48:21.750
Do it quickly. Ma'am might come!
I'll be in trouble!

00:48:21.775 --> 00:48:23.425
Just once more, sir!
-Okay, do it.

00:48:37.134 --> 00:48:39.592
Another call from the same number,
bro!

00:48:47.884 --> 00:48:49.259
Hello?
-Hello?

00:48:49.384 --> 00:48:50.717
This is Amudha speaking.

00:48:52.092 --> 00:48:53.925
Are you coming to visit me tomorrow?

00:48:55.337 --> 00:48:56.618
How are we related?

00:49:42.381 --> 00:49:43.631
Damn it!
He got away!

00:49:45.259 --> 00:49:46.259
Faster!

00:49:46.384 --> 00:49:47.800
Stop for nothing!
Drive fast!

00:49:48.766 --> 00:49:51.415
Hello?
Hello?

00:49:54.188 --> 00:49:55.842
He must not cross Tittivanam!

00:49:55.905 --> 00:49:57.134
Is the stuff inside?
-Yes!

00:49:57.259 --> 00:49:58.800
He mustn't cross the forest!
-Hurry!

00:49:58.925 --> 00:50:00.342
Go! Go! Go!

00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:17.342
Can you hear me?
Hello?

00:50:24.884 --> 00:50:27.092
Two vehicles are behind us! Drive faster!
-Sir!

00:50:27.217 --> 00:50:29.092
Who are these guys?
What's going on?

00:50:29.217 --> 00:50:30.967
Stop asking questions
and drive fast!

00:50:31.092 --> 00:50:32.675
The vehicle can only go this fast!

00:50:33.634 --> 00:50:34.675
Get closer!

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.967
Go left!
-Get closer!

00:50:37.842 --> 00:50:38.842
Drive faster!

00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:43.967
He's not saying anything.

00:50:44.555 --> 00:50:46.050
Alright, give it to me.

00:50:49.384 --> 00:50:51.134
All the glass is shattered, sir!

00:50:51.259 --> 00:50:53.134
How do I explain this back home?

00:50:54.342 --> 00:50:56.175
Keep going!
Take a right!

00:51:01.967 --> 00:51:04.300
Don't let them overtake you! Go right!
-He's going!

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.217
Take the rod
and break open that lock!

00:51:10.342 --> 00:51:12.092
I'll handle it!
Get the rod!

00:51:20.634 --> 00:51:22.425
Don't step on it like it's dung!
Faster!

00:51:23.071 --> 00:51:25.717
They're close!
Drive faster!

00:51:26.425 --> 00:51:28.092
Step on it!
-Break the lock!

00:51:28.217 --> 00:51:30.634
They're overtaking us!
Take a left!

00:51:37.842 --> 00:51:39.050
Get even closer!

00:51:39.175 --> 00:51:41.717
Look that side!
-Step on it!

00:51:54.467 --> 00:51:56.092
They've opened the back door, sir!

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:01.592
Head back!
Looks like the I.G. might fall!

00:52:01.717 --> 00:52:04.092
Get him back in! Hurry!
-You go, sir!

00:52:04.217 --> 00:52:06.800
Why are you sending a kid? If he gets hurt?
I brought him along!

00:52:06.925 --> 00:52:08.734
Look at my hand! How do I go?

00:52:08.804 --> 00:52:10.226
You go!
-Sir!

00:52:10.297 --> 00:52:11.281
Stay here!

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.797
Do you know who that is?
The Inspector General!

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:17.717
Does that make him a big shot?
He's just fated for a short life!

00:52:17.742 --> 00:52:19.034
You stay here!
-Listen up!

00:52:19.259 --> 00:52:22.300
If anything happens to him,
you won't go home alive! Now head back!

00:52:23.092 --> 00:52:24.092
Go quickly!

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.050
Maintain the same distance!

00:52:39.175 --> 00:52:40.842
Attach the hook onto the truck!

00:52:40.967 --> 00:52:42.675
Toss out anyone you find!

00:52:49.425 --> 00:52:51.175
Throw it at them!
-Do it!

00:52:53.217 --> 00:52:55.050
Toss it right at the driver!

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:02.175
Faster!

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.925
Get me that hook!
-Here!

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:05.384
Get closer!

00:53:05.509 --> 00:53:07.384
Driver faster!
-Step on it!

00:53:07.509 --> 00:53:08.509
Get closer!

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:17.550
Hey! The guys are here!
Come on!

00:53:17.675 --> 00:53:19.800
Hurry up!
-Here you go!

00:53:19.925 --> 00:53:21.675
Light it up!
Quickly!

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.217
Light it up!

00:53:24.925 --> 00:53:26.842
Give it to me!
-Come up front!

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.092
Toss that petrol bomb!

00:53:30.217 --> 00:53:31.467
Give it to me!

00:53:38.884 --> 00:53:40.675
Climb on!
Climb on top of it!

00:53:44.759 --> 00:53:46.134
Throw it at the driver's face!

00:53:48.342 --> 00:53:49.884
Give it!
-Toss it at his face!

00:53:50.399 --> 00:53:51.940
-Bro!

00:54:18.092 --> 00:54:19.717
Step on it!
Hurry!

00:54:19.842 --> 00:54:21.300
The clutch is broken, jackass!

00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:22.759
It can't move any further!

00:54:24.342 --> 00:54:25.509
Hold the steering wheel!

00:54:36.884 --> 00:54:38.134
Go up front!
I'll handle it!

00:54:51.467 --> 00:54:53.134
The fuel's leaking!
Stop it!

00:55:15.509 --> 00:55:16.675
Jump out!

00:55:17.967 --> 00:55:20.509
Get out, guys!

00:55:32.307 --> 00:55:33.509
I hear a motorbike, sir.

00:56:09.117 --> 00:56:10.515
Hello?
-Hello!

00:56:11.398 --> 00:56:13.189
A girl spoke to me.

00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:16.231
Can I talk to her, sir?

00:56:16.356 --> 00:56:17.356
Who are you?

00:56:19.564 --> 00:56:20.564
I am...

00:56:21.603 --> 00:56:22.981
I am her father, sir.

00:56:23.106 --> 00:56:26.641
You abandoned her at this ashram
and shamelessly say you're her father?

00:56:28.439 --> 00:56:30.148
All my bad luck, sir.

00:56:30.273 --> 00:56:32.939
You know how many times
Amudha tried calling you?

00:56:33.064 --> 00:56:35.189
You didn't pick up at all.

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:38.064
Poor girl walked away,
hanging her head.

00:56:39.231 --> 00:56:42.064
Cell phone signal was down
as I was going through the forest.

00:56:43.231 --> 00:56:46.148
The line got cut off
before I could say a word.

00:56:46.273 --> 00:56:48.273
Can you please call that child, sir?

00:56:48.398 --> 00:56:49.939
It's pretty hard, my man.

00:56:50.064 --> 00:56:53.023
Think your child
is studying in a convent school?

00:56:53.148 --> 00:56:55.648
This is an orphange.

00:56:55.714 --> 00:56:59.189
All the 150 girls here
stay in one room.

00:56:59.314 --> 00:57:03.731
They're sleeping all over the place
while being bitten by mosquitoes!

00:57:04.356 --> 00:57:05.356
I understand, sir.

00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:09.564
I've never seen my child's face
since she was born.

00:57:11.273 --> 00:57:13.023
I'll pay you when I come in the morning.

00:57:13.148 --> 00:57:15.116
What?
You'll pay me?

00:57:15.913 --> 00:57:19.564
Expect me to take a bribe to let a father
and child speak for the first time...

00:57:19.689 --> 00:57:21.023
...and die in shame for that?

00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:22.856
I said I can't...

00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:26.481
I said I can't go in right now.
Try to understand.

00:57:26.606 --> 00:57:27.606
Please forgive me.

00:57:29.398 --> 00:57:31.731
When I heard my child's voice
for the first time...

00:57:32.814 --> 00:57:34.481
...I just got floored.

00:57:34.606 --> 00:57:36.490
That's why I spoke that way.
Somehow...

00:57:36.606 --> 00:57:39.773
I recall seeing Amudha's photo
on the notice board once.

00:57:39.898 --> 00:57:41.273
If it's there,
I'll send it.

00:57:41.398 --> 00:57:43.314
Do you have WhatsApp?
-Yes.

00:57:43.439 --> 00:57:44.564
Bless you, sir.

00:57:44.689 --> 00:57:46.273
First let me check if it's there.

00:57:48.856 --> 00:57:51.273
If you just go straight,
we'll reach Tittivanam.

00:57:51.398 --> 00:57:52.648
Just twelve kilometers.

00:57:52.773 --> 00:57:55.564
Hard to travel by this vehicle.
All forest area!

00:57:55.689 --> 00:57:57.648
No proper lights or roads.

00:57:59.148 --> 00:58:00.356
Start up the vehicle.

00:58:01.731 --> 00:58:02.731
I can't do it, sir.

00:58:04.106 --> 00:58:06.273
You asked me to drop you off
and go about my way.

00:58:06.379 --> 00:58:09.356
Who the hell are those guys?
They would've killed us!

00:58:09.481 --> 00:58:11.148
I'll explain everything.
Now come!

00:58:11.273 --> 00:58:12.314
I won't do it, sir!

00:58:12.439 --> 00:58:13.523
Tell me what's going on!

00:58:14.523 --> 00:58:16.064
You all will booze
and pass out!

00:58:16.189 --> 00:58:17.439
Should we suffer for it?

00:58:17.564 --> 00:58:19.148
What the hell was that, sir?

00:58:19.273 --> 00:58:20.856
Think you cops can do anything?

00:58:20.981 --> 00:58:22.606
What about the truck, sir?

00:58:22.731 --> 00:58:25.231
Your truck will be restored
to the way it was! Get in!

00:58:25.356 --> 00:58:28.189
The truck can be fixed.
What if he had died?

00:58:28.314 --> 00:58:30.106
I'm going!
I'll walk the rest of the way!

00:58:30.231 --> 00:58:33.189
Find the route yourself!
Inviting me for my own death, huh?

00:58:33.314 --> 00:58:36.356
They're not the drunken rogues
that you think they are!

00:58:36.481 --> 00:58:39.064
They're cops who've been on the job
for 10-15 years!

00:58:39.189 --> 00:58:41.648
They've been intentionally drugged!
Come!

00:58:44.773 --> 00:58:47.398
You know what will happen
if they reclaim these drugs?

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:48.523
You won't understand!

00:58:48.648 --> 00:58:50.564
Start the truck
if you want to see your child!

00:58:56.648 --> 00:58:58.189
Wait!
Did you drink?

00:58:58.314 --> 00:59:01.648
Oh, so it's fine for them to drink,
but it's not okay if I do?

00:59:01.711 --> 00:59:04.158
Stand before a stove all day!
You'll see how it ache!

00:59:08.283 --> 00:59:09.492
They've left, bro.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.391
Pull over here, bro!

00:59:25.703 --> 00:59:27.062
What is it?
Isn't this the route?

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.320
Yes. But don't know if we go left or right.
-Hello

00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:31.589
I've sent the photo. See it.
-Alright, sir.

00:59:32.396 --> 00:59:33.797
Yes, Tips!

00:59:33.922 --> 00:59:35.922
Check post number ten!
-Have you crossed it?

00:59:36.047 --> 00:59:37.797
No!
We haven't turned back!

00:59:39.047 --> 00:59:40.881
Take the left, bro.
We'll handle it.

00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:50.006
He turned left
at the check post!

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:13.964
I received a photo.

01:00:14.032 --> 01:00:15.860
This thing's just spinning.
Check it.

01:00:16.172 --> 01:00:18.756
Ah! If there's the letter 'E',
the image won't download.

01:00:18.851 --> 01:00:21.131
If you had 3G or 4G,
there'd be instant download!

01:00:21.256 --> 01:00:24.422
My phone is with my uncle.
Else, I would've shown it to you.

01:00:24.547 --> 01:00:26.422
Shall I ask the cop for internet, bro?

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:28.400
Hey!
It appears no one is inside.

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:30.339
Go stand by the vehicle.
-Okay.

01:00:38.908 --> 01:00:40.631
To me, all crows are black, bro!

01:00:40.756 --> 01:00:42.339
But don't they know their parents?

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:45.297
Just go and watch
how your daughter runs right to you, bro!

01:00:45.422 --> 01:00:46.422
What do you say, sir?

01:00:46.547 --> 01:00:49.572
Hey! The road's empty, right?
Step on it!

01:00:56.922 --> 01:01:00.256
At the rate it's spinning, it'll blow wind
but won't download the photo!

01:01:01.214 --> 01:01:02.547
This phone is crap!

01:01:02.672 --> 01:01:04.964
Heard of Oppo or Vivo phones?

01:01:05.072 --> 01:01:07.631
That Vivo V5 model?
Should've bought one of those!

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.506
Look over there, bro!

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.047
Don't stop!
Step on it!

01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:18.422
Keep going!

01:01:18.547 --> 01:01:19.547
Drive fast!

01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:21.922
Faster!
Don't stop!

01:01:38.214 --> 01:01:40.131
Reverse!
Back up!

01:01:41.101 --> 01:01:42.937
Faster!
-Go fast, bro!

01:02:22.089 --> 01:02:23.589
A vehicle's coming from behind!

01:02:51.172 --> 01:02:53.006
What happened?
-The lights are out.

01:02:53.131 --> 01:02:55.589
Don't know if it's safe to go in.
What do we do?

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:57.506
Go break the door.

01:02:58.881 --> 01:02:59.881
See if you have a rod.

01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:04.547
They've got knives and sticks, bro!
Do something!

01:03:04.672 --> 01:03:06.339
See if you can turn the truck around!

01:03:06.464 --> 01:03:09.006
All forest area around us, sir!
-Run over them and go!

01:03:09.131 --> 01:03:11.047
I can't run them over
and go back to prison.

01:03:11.172 --> 01:03:13.256
Just run them down!
I'll handle the fallout!

01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:17.714
Hey!

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.381
I cornered the truck!

01:03:19.506 --> 01:03:21.589
Those five heads are mine!

01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:23.464
Just go back the way you came!

01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:24.922
How's that, now?

01:03:25.047 --> 01:03:28.631
I set up the bamboo to block the truck
and forced it to change routes!

01:03:28.756 --> 01:03:30.797
You'll take the five heads!

01:03:30.922 --> 01:03:32.922
Am I a simpleton?

01:03:33.047 --> 01:03:36.881
So I can tie the nuptial thread
but you get to enjoy the wedding night?

01:03:37.006 --> 01:03:38.006
Why not?

01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:40.631
If you come late,
I'd be the one to do it!

01:03:40.756 --> 01:03:42.547
I'm the one that trapped them!

01:03:42.672 --> 01:03:45.256
You came from the back!
I stand up front!

01:03:45.381 --> 01:03:47.547
Doesn't take much
to attack a trapped rat!

01:03:47.672 --> 01:03:49.006
Go back quietly!

01:03:49.131 --> 01:03:50.672
Let's fight it out!

01:03:50.797 --> 01:03:52.714
Whoever wins
gets to take the heads!

01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:55.589
What the hell are you thinking?
Drive!

01:03:56.464 --> 01:03:58.047
How long have you been in business?

01:03:58.172 --> 01:03:59.422
What is it, bro?
-What?

01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:02.214
Didn't have the guts to finish the job
once you had him!

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.526
Now you raise your voice here, you prick?
Can you see?

01:04:05.739 --> 01:04:08.381
You said you'd ensure
I'd never see my daughter again.

01:04:09.506 --> 01:04:11.339
I had no other options.

01:04:11.464 --> 01:04:13.547
I'll bury them and go about my way!
-Do it now.

01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:15.922
I'm honestly not that type of man!

01:04:16.047 --> 01:04:18.464
If I didn't say so,
you wouldn't have agreed to drive!

01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:20.562
All those guys in the back
have families!

01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:22.089
Go!
-Why, sir?

01:04:22.214 --> 01:04:23.547
No one will leave here alive!

01:04:23.672 --> 01:04:25.464
Don't we people have families, too?

01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:27.839
(A caller tune plays)

01:04:33.256 --> 01:04:34.922
Mr. Ranga!
This is Saga's brother!

01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:36.631
We've chased them this far!

01:04:36.756 --> 01:04:39.089
Let's make a deal!
They burned five of our guys!

01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:43.297
It's Saga's brother. He wants to make
a deal. Some of their men were burned.

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:44.631
What deal?
-Alright, sir.

01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:47.256
I'll forget everything you said.

01:04:48.078 --> 01:04:50.714
I'll drop you off
without a single scratch.

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:53.047
What will you give me?

01:04:53.172 --> 01:04:56.006
I'll give you anything!
No time to bargain! Start the vehicle!

01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:58.506
This is my time, sir.
-Alright. How much do you want?

01:04:58.631 --> 01:05:00.631
Who wants your money?
-Then what do you want?

01:05:04.756 --> 01:05:06.631
A room for my daughter.

01:05:09.131 --> 01:05:10.297
A fan just for her.

01:05:12.756 --> 01:05:13.922
A bed.

01:05:16.172 --> 01:05:17.589
A good school for her to study.

01:05:21.672 --> 01:05:22.672
Can you do this?

01:05:22.797 --> 01:05:24.589
Educating your child
is no big issue!

01:05:24.714 --> 01:05:26.464
If they know you saved the I.G...
-Sir!

01:05:27.665 --> 01:05:29.714
Will you make this happen?
-I will!

01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:30.839
Promise me.

01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:36.006
Let's make a deal!

01:05:36.839 --> 01:05:39.756
You take three heads!
Leave two for me!

01:05:40.689 --> 01:05:42.089
I also did the work, right?

01:05:43.381 --> 01:05:44.964
I promise to do it!
Now step on it!

01:05:45.089 --> 01:05:47.881
You may have done the work...
-You promise with the left hand?

01:05:49.216 --> 01:05:50.881
What if you forget
in the morning?

01:05:51.006 --> 01:05:52.797
Now you intrude
and negotitate?

01:05:52.922 --> 01:05:55.006
Losers get no deals!
-Listen up!

01:05:55.131 --> 01:05:58.756
This is my daughter. I'll see to it
your daughter studies in her school!

01:05:58.881 --> 01:06:00.506
I swear upon my daughter.

01:06:00.631 --> 01:06:01.631
Please drive!

01:06:03.006 --> 01:06:04.006
Drive!

01:06:04.131 --> 01:06:07.339
Let's pretend to agree.
Only four of them are here, right?

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.983
We'll kill all of them.

01:06:09.092 --> 01:06:10.589
But one thing!

01:06:10.714 --> 01:06:12.381
The guy who drove the vehicle?

01:06:12.506 --> 01:06:14.297
The one with handcuffs?

01:06:14.422 --> 01:06:15.964
He's mine!

01:06:16.089 --> 01:06:17.381
Don't touch him!

01:06:18.506 --> 01:06:20.464
Stay there!
I'll call after wrapping this...

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:22.506
Where are you going?
We're surrounded!

01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:24.047
What are you doing, bro?

01:06:26.422 --> 01:06:28.797
You only know that I've been in prison
for ten years.

01:06:30.172 --> 01:06:32.881
You don't know what I was doing
before I went to jail, right?

01:07:14.019 --> 01:07:16.144
Leave him.
They'll take care of him.

01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:17.936
Go bring over those five cops.

01:07:18.936 --> 01:07:19.936
Go, guys.

01:07:39.352 --> 01:07:41.561
Hey!
Step aside.

01:07:42.727 --> 01:07:43.769
Can't you listen...

01:08:05.144 --> 01:08:06.144
Go!

01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:39.186
Go!
Attack him from the back!

01:08:56.852 --> 01:08:57.977
Look here, bro!

01:09:05.727 --> 01:09:06.727
Bro!

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:09.519
Bro!
Behind you!

01:09:31.269 --> 01:10:03.419
Look here, sir!

01:10:20.018 --> 01:10:21.685
A man's in the back of the truck, bro!

01:10:40.226 --> 01:10:43.835
Until today, no one in my family
has even set foot in a police station!

01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:46.749
Why?
They directly go to the court, huh?

01:10:48.601 --> 01:10:50.685
What do you study?
-Engineering.

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:51.935
EC Engineering.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.435
You study engineering
and loiter drunk like so?

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.060
That's why we loiter drunk, sir!

01:10:57.476 --> 01:10:59.393
Someone's breaking the gate, sir!

01:11:16.768 --> 01:11:19.268
Get down, guys!
-Mani! Give everyone their weapons!

01:11:30.768 --> 01:11:33.060
Listen up!
I don't care who is in there!

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.226
You have five minutes!

01:11:35.976 --> 01:11:39.476
Open the door!
I'll take my stuff and go on my way!

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.060
If I break in and enter,
none of you will remain alive!

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:51.976
There about twenty to thirty people
at the entrance, sir.

01:11:52.101 --> 01:11:53.185
What do I do, sir?

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:55.851
Hold on, Napoleon.
Don't be afraid.

01:11:55.976 --> 01:11:58.101
Where are you, sir?
-I'm on my way!

01:11:58.226 --> 01:11:59.851
I'll call back. Hang up.
-Okay, sir.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.310
Sir!

01:12:16.935 --> 01:12:18.393
See if there's another way in.

01:12:18.518 --> 01:12:19.518
Come on, guys!

01:12:22.935 --> 01:12:25.893
Go look that side!
-Who's in there?

01:12:26.018 --> 01:12:29.476
Only one of them had a gun, sir.
Had to bring it with his holster. Here.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.726
Hey!
Light it up.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.143
How long for the vehicle to be ready?

01:12:37.268 --> 01:12:39.435
The clutch and brake have heated up.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.643
Take about 10-15 minutes
to cool down.

01:12:41.768 --> 01:12:44.518
Can't explain this to my mother.
Please handle this.

01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:47.185
This truck
is our family's livelihood!

01:12:48.518 --> 01:12:49.601
Napoleon?
-Sir?

01:12:50.393 --> 01:12:54.310
They're breaking everything! What to do?
-Hold on! Don't be scared!

01:12:54.435 --> 01:12:56.351
Listen carefully to what I say.
-Alright.

01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:58.476
Go to the cell at the top floor.

01:12:58.601 --> 01:12:59.768
Move aside.

01:12:59.893 --> 01:13:02.185
They'll be a guy in a blue shirt.
Give him the phone.

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:03.601
Alright.
-Wait. No need.

01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:07.060
Ask the college kids
if any of them can make a video call.

01:13:07.185 --> 01:13:10.226
What's going on?
-Can we make a video call on your phone?

01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:12.643
Yes, we can.
-I'll call you from that, sir!

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.143
Who's in there?
Come out!

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.351
Sir?
-Hold it this way and talk, sir.

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.018
Tell me, sir.
-Hey, Blue shirt.

01:13:26.143 --> 01:13:29.101
The one in the corner.
Step up front.

01:13:29.226 --> 01:13:30.643
Can you see me?

01:13:30.768 --> 01:13:32.768
Yes, sir.
-Talk to your guys who are outside.

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:35.351
The drugs you're after isn't here.

01:13:35.476 --> 01:13:37.143
Tell him I'll let you guys go.

01:13:37.268 --> 01:13:39.393
No harm must come to my people there.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:41.810
Ask him to give me a phone.

01:13:41.935 --> 01:13:43.851
Give him your phone, Napoleon.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:43.976 --> 01:13:45.393
Give it.
-Here you go.

01:13:49.101 --> 01:13:50.726
Get a Jio SIM once you get back!

01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:53.435
He's making a video call.
You're still looking for a signal!

01:13:54.226 --> 01:13:55.226
Anbu?

01:13:55.351 --> 01:13:56.726
Who is this?
-It's Shankar.

01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:58.643
Where are you?
How did you get this phone?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.435
The policeman...
he's on the phone right now.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.143
He's making a deal.

01:14:04.268 --> 01:14:05.810
They'll let us go.

01:14:05.935 --> 01:14:08.226
But we must not hurt
the people here.

01:14:08.351 --> 01:14:09.685
Is my brother safe?

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:11.351
Tell me.
Wasn't he with you?

01:14:11.476 --> 01:14:13.393
He's on a video call, Anbu.

01:14:13.518 --> 01:14:15.132
Say it in a way I'll understand!

01:14:17.185 --> 01:14:18.226
The boss...

01:14:18.351 --> 01:14:19.768
The cop...

01:14:20.518 --> 01:14:22.685
I said he's on the line.
-Is he inside?

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:26.976
Yes, Anbu.
-Alright! I won't do anything!

01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:28.351
No one here will come in!

01:14:28.476 --> 01:14:30.149
No harm will come from my side!

01:14:30.259 --> 01:14:32.717
Open the door and you guys come out!
Agree to the deal!

01:14:32.842 --> 01:14:34.509
Agree to the deal!
-Alright, Anbu!

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.800
He accepts the deal.
Open it up.

01:14:38.759 --> 01:14:40.009
Tell everyone to back off.

01:14:40.675 --> 01:14:42.342
Open up the cell.
-Yes, sir.

01:14:42.467 --> 01:14:44.800
No harm will come to you all.
You may leave safely.

01:14:44.925 --> 01:14:45.925
Alright.

01:14:47.217 --> 01:14:48.217
What are they doing?

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:58.884
The seven guys who were caught
were low level thugs, sir.

01:14:59.009 --> 01:15:00.550
They'll let us go.

01:15:00.675 --> 01:15:03.259
But we must not hurt
the people here.

01:15:03.384 --> 01:15:04.884
I said he's on the line.

01:15:06.842 --> 01:15:09.675
Yes, Anbu.
He's inside.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800
Open it up!

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:13.342
Alright, sir.
Come on.

01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:16.800
Truck's ready. Shall we go?
-Hold on!

01:15:18.425 --> 01:15:19.842
Yes, sir?
-Napoleon!

01:15:19.967 --> 01:15:21.550
Opened the cell?
-I'm about to!

01:15:21.675 --> 01:15:24.717
Don't do it. First listen to me.
-What is it, sir?

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.592
Ask the names of those inside!
-Yes, sir.

01:15:30.717 --> 01:15:31.717
What's your name?

01:15:32.384 --> 01:15:33.384
Hitler!

01:15:33.509 --> 01:15:34.759
Your name?
-Gopal.

01:15:34.884 --> 01:15:36.259
And you?
-Shankar.

01:15:36.384 --> 01:15:37.384
You?
-Moorthy!

01:15:38.592 --> 01:15:39.592
Who is he?

01:15:39.717 --> 01:15:41.509
Hey!
What's your name?

01:15:41.634 --> 01:15:43.175
What?
Are you hard of hearing?

01:15:45.592 --> 01:15:47.259
What happened?

01:15:47.384 --> 01:15:48.592
My brother's inside.

01:15:48.717 --> 01:15:50.675
They nabbed him
without knowing who he is.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.550
First, let him step out safely.

01:15:52.675 --> 01:15:54.759
Then, we will kill everyone in there!

01:15:55.925 --> 01:15:57.550
Hey!
What's your name?

01:16:04.634 --> 01:16:07.509
One of them's not telling me his name,
sir!

01:16:07.634 --> 01:16:08.800
Step back.

01:16:09.675 --> 01:16:10.884
He's Adaikalam.

01:16:11.009 --> 01:16:13.425
If he's out,
he won't spare any of you.

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:15.759
Whatever you do, don't open the door.
Back away!

01:16:18.759 --> 01:16:20.134
Sir!
-Give me the key!

01:16:20.259 --> 01:16:22.175
Ajay!
-I'll chop you up!

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.467
Hurry up!

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.092
Give it!
Give me the key!

01:16:26.217 --> 01:16:27.550
Hello?
Napoleon?

01:16:29.175 --> 01:16:30.175
Give me the key!

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.384
Give it!

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:37.884
Hurry up, guys!

01:16:38.009 --> 01:16:39.800
Hurry! Let's go!
Where's Dilli?

01:16:39.925 --> 01:16:41.634
He's looking for a signal there!
-Come!

01:16:42.329 --> 01:16:43.400
Give me the key!

01:16:44.842 --> 01:16:46.884
Ajay!
-Throw me that key.

01:16:47.009 --> 01:16:48.384
Pick up that key!

01:16:50.641 --> 01:16:51.593
Come on!

01:16:53.474 --> 01:16:55.433
Dilli!
Start the vehicle!

01:16:55.558 --> 01:16:57.308
Only forty kilometers to go.
Hurry!

01:16:58.224 --> 01:16:59.558
What happened?
Let's go!

01:17:00.474 --> 01:17:01.474
What is it?

01:17:02.974 --> 01:17:04.349
Toss it here!
-Ajay!

01:17:04.474 --> 01:17:07.016
Toss me the key!
-They caught hold of him!

01:17:07.141 --> 01:17:09.141
Throw me the key!
-He might die!

01:17:09.266 --> 01:17:10.683
When I get out, I'll kill you!

01:17:13.058 --> 01:17:14.349
Don't give it to him!

01:17:15.933 --> 01:17:17.266
Shut the doors, guys!

01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:18.724
Shut the doors!

01:17:21.641 --> 01:17:22.641
Charge!

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:42.891
My child, sir.

01:17:46.433 --> 01:17:47.854
If one has a child...

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:50.599
...they never die, right?

01:17:52.224 --> 01:17:53.681
She has my eyes.

01:17:56.016 --> 01:17:58.688
She has her mother's nose and forehead.

01:17:59.183 --> 01:18:01.849
Even she used to get dimples
when she smiled.

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:04.150
She's in her, too.

01:18:05.308 --> 01:18:06.683
Look how she stands, sir!

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.266
Does she look like a killer's daughter?

01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:12.766
Doesn't she look like a cop's daughter?
-Yes, Dilli.

01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:15.141
I want to hold her right now!

01:18:15.266 --> 01:18:17.558
Then come!
If we go quickly, you can see her soon!

01:18:17.683 --> 01:18:19.808
Will I see her, sir?
-Definitely, Dilli!

01:18:19.933 --> 01:18:22.433
How much further, sir?
-We're halfway there, bro!

01:18:22.558 --> 01:18:24.433
Cross the hill
and there's the hospital!

01:18:24.558 --> 01:18:25.558
Let's go, sir.

01:18:30.933 --> 01:18:33.224
Tips!
The vehicle's off.

01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:35.224
His name is Dilli!

01:18:36.016 --> 01:18:38.674
You must kill him first
to get close to the cops!

01:18:39.308 --> 01:18:41.384
What did you say his name was?
-Dilli!

01:19:25.769 --> 01:19:27.228
See if you can break any of these.

01:19:29.269 --> 01:19:30.978
Break it all down!
Go!

01:19:32.103 --> 01:19:33.478
Break them open!

01:19:34.345 --> 01:19:35.732
Hit hard!
-Break it!

01:19:37.626 --> 01:19:38.709
Break it!

01:19:39.349 --> 01:19:41.349
Made out of forest wood!
Can't break it!

01:19:41.415 --> 01:19:42.873
What is it?
-No, Anbu.

01:19:42.998 --> 01:19:46.248
Seems like an old British building.
Really strong doors and windows.

01:19:46.373 --> 01:19:48.165
Not so easy to break in.

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:49.957
I'll see if there's another way in.

01:19:50.082 --> 01:19:52.082
Three of you go look that side!

01:19:52.808 --> 01:19:55.332
Where are you guys?
Hey, Tips!

01:19:56.165 --> 01:19:57.873
Tell everyone to stop!
-Get down!

01:19:57.998 --> 01:19:59.123
Hold on, guys!

01:19:59.559 --> 01:20:00.684
Stop!

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540
Hey!

01:20:03.373 --> 01:20:06.248
They savagely beat everyone
and drove up the hill!

01:20:06.373 --> 01:20:07.957
Who is he?

01:20:08.082 --> 01:20:09.582
His name's Dilli.

01:20:09.707 --> 01:20:11.332
It seems like he escaped prison.

01:20:11.457 --> 01:20:13.082
He's going around with handcuffs.

01:20:13.207 --> 01:20:15.165
Don't know why he's working
for the cops.

01:20:16.082 --> 01:20:18.457
He gores like a rhino, Mr. Prabha.

01:20:18.582 --> 01:20:21.498
He beat the crap
out of Krishna and Guna.

01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:24.790
He sports holy ash on his head
and dances around like God!

01:20:24.915 --> 01:20:28.082
Say you couldn't do it!
Don't bring God into this!

01:20:28.207 --> 01:20:30.040
Ajay! I'm near Thavakudi!

01:20:30.165 --> 01:20:32.832
Tell Tane that I asked him
to come to that high school!

01:20:32.957 --> 01:20:33.998
I'll call back.

01:20:35.123 --> 01:20:36.707
On my way, doctor!
-Bejoy!

01:20:37.623 --> 01:20:41.832
Based on my research, chances are high
that this drug may be Rohypnol.

01:20:41.957 --> 01:20:44.082
So?
-It's a heavy sedative!

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.915
Even more dangerous.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.832
But no one can acquire this drug.

01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:49.332
Hard to access it!

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.540
Someone in your department
who handles drugs must've done this.

01:20:54.707 --> 01:20:57.332
Already been three hours, Bejoy.
Hurry!

01:20:57.457 --> 01:20:59.123
We delay further, people might die!

01:20:59.248 --> 01:21:00.915
Alright, doctor.
On my way!

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.165
'Even if a child forgets his mother...'

01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:05.748
'Or if a mother forgets her child...'

01:21:05.873 --> 01:21:08.582
'If life forgets the body...'

01:21:08.707 --> 01:21:11.082
'Or if the body forgets life...'

01:21:11.207 --> 01:21:13.373
'Even if you forget
all you have learned...'

01:21:13.498 --> 01:21:16.640
'Or if the eyes forget to blink...'

01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:20.121
'The Lord who rooted us here...'

01:21:20.199 --> 01:21:23.790
'Namashivaaya...I shall never forget!'

01:21:25.332 --> 01:21:26.748
Praise be to Lord Shiva!

01:21:32.498 --> 01:21:34.957
Men have surrounded the hill!
They might hear you, bro!

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:38.373
I don't believe in this sort of thing!

01:21:39.082 --> 01:21:40.082
One day, you will.

01:21:41.748 --> 01:21:43.130
How many guys on your side?

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.165
About seventeen.

01:21:46.248 --> 01:21:48.968
How many guys on our side?
-About twenty, brother.

01:21:49.836 --> 01:21:51.795
Let two guys watch
the centre of the hill.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.711
Forty of us will swoop down together!

01:21:53.836 --> 01:21:55.753
One guy covers every ten feet!

01:21:55.878 --> 01:21:58.086
What was his name?
Bombay? Delhi?

01:21:59.086 --> 01:22:00.961
Let's see how he gets down this hill!

01:22:07.461 --> 01:22:10.295
See that, sir? The guys who chased us
have surrounded the hill!

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.378
Wherever the truck goes,
they'll attack!

01:22:14.253 --> 01:22:15.420
What do we do, Dilli?

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.336
You tell me, sir.
I'll do it.

01:22:18.461 --> 01:22:20.420
If I tell you,
you'll ask if I'm crazy.

01:22:29.086 --> 01:22:29.943
Alright, tell me.

01:22:30.036 --> 01:22:32.477
Hey, Tips! Can you see me?
-It's the boss!

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:34.852
Over here!
-Tell me!

01:22:35.685 --> 01:22:37.094
Tell me!
-Do you hear me?

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.518
Can you hear me?

01:22:39.643 --> 01:22:40.810
Yes!

01:22:40.935 --> 01:22:42.185
Listen up!

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:45.286
There's an iron door behind this building!
-What?

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.599
Hoist me higher!

01:22:47.102 --> 01:22:48.352
An iron door!

01:22:48.477 --> 01:22:50.790
He's telling them of a way inside
from up there!

01:22:58.279 --> 01:22:59.060
Saw what's down there?

01:22:59.185 --> 01:23:02.193
Make it sound like it's nothing!
We get caught, only five die!

01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:04.518
You're trying to kill us all?
Are you crazy?

01:23:05.435 --> 01:23:07.447
See that?
Said you'd react this way!

01:23:07.518 --> 01:23:08.893
Now you yourself...

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:10.851
We're surrounded by forests!

01:23:10.976 --> 01:23:13.226
He's stopped atop the hill!

01:23:13.351 --> 01:23:14.560
Don't know exactly where!

01:23:16.018 --> 01:23:17.893
Come by Thittakudi!

01:23:18.018 --> 01:23:19.351
See if there's a hill there!

01:23:19.476 --> 01:23:20.893
What's wrong?
-What is it, bro?

01:23:29.935 --> 01:23:31.810
They're just blubbering drunk!

01:23:31.935 --> 01:23:34.351
Shut up and sleep!
Don't know the situation we're in!

01:23:39.518 --> 01:23:41.726
An iron door!

01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:43.476
Iron what?
-An iron door!

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:45.268
Iron door. Got it!
-In the back!

01:23:45.393 --> 01:23:48.268
There's an iron door in the back!
-Head back!

01:23:48.393 --> 01:23:49.643
An iron door!

01:23:49.768 --> 01:23:52.643
Can I do something to ensure
no one out can hear him?

01:23:52.768 --> 01:23:53.935
What are you going to do?

01:23:55.185 --> 01:23:56.185
Are you there?

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.624
Guide me, O Lord Shiva!

01:24:18.268 --> 01:24:20.435
Come on!
The truck's heading this way!

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.185
Come!
We'll pin it down!

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:23.851
Truck's coming this way!
Come on!

01:24:39.851 --> 01:24:41.435
The truck's on that side!
Come on!

01:24:43.726 --> 01:24:44.976
Get up!
Watch your step!

01:25:51.726 --> 01:25:52.935
Come along, sir!

01:25:59.185 --> 01:26:01.226
Come quickly, sir!

01:26:01.351 --> 01:26:03.518
Pull over somewhere, bro!
-Don't spare them!

01:26:03.643 --> 01:26:05.060
Come on, guys!

01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:10.310
Get in quickly!

01:26:11.226 --> 01:26:12.393
Get in!

01:26:17.393 --> 01:26:19.178
Come on, sir!
-Where's Sir?

01:26:21.393 --> 01:26:22.768
He's out there!

01:26:22.893 --> 01:26:24.560
Make sure he gets in!
-Come on, sir!

01:26:26.643 --> 01:26:28.768
Come on, sir!
You're close!

01:26:28.893 --> 01:26:30.726
Come! Take my hand, sir!
-Kill him!

01:26:30.851 --> 01:26:32.427
Hurry up, sir!

01:26:33.075 --> 01:26:33.833
Sir!

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.685
They managed to strike him, bro!

01:26:44.643 --> 01:26:46.601
What do we do now, bro?

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:04.643
Brother!

01:27:04.768 --> 01:27:05.976
He's the guy, brother!

01:27:09.518 --> 01:27:10.518
What the hell?

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:12.060
So much build-up!

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560
Hey!

01:27:15.101 --> 01:27:16.518
I don't know who you are!

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.810
I don't know why you work for the cops!

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:22.435
All I want are five guys inside the truck!

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560
Hey!
Give me that!

01:27:24.685 --> 01:27:27.851
Bejoy, Thiru, Kumar, Joseph
and Sudhakar!

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:31.393
Just hand me these guys
and go on your way with the rest!

01:27:31.518 --> 01:27:32.518
Hey!

01:27:33.643 --> 01:27:36.143
I gave my word
that I'd drop them at their destination!

01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:41.325
Settle your dispute
after I've dropped them off!

01:27:42.143 --> 01:27:44.101
Hey!
Go get them.

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:45.226
Shoot.

01:27:47.726 --> 01:27:49.435
Bro...
-That chump has a gun!

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.768
It's just a toy gun!
Go!

01:27:51.893 --> 01:27:52.893
Pull the trigger!

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.435
He's got a gun, brother!

01:27:58.768 --> 01:28:00.393
If you're scared,
close your eyes!

01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:06.226
Are you a cop
to shoot below the knee?

01:28:06.351 --> 01:28:08.226
He'll account for the bullets!

01:28:08.351 --> 01:28:09.351
Blow their brains out!

01:28:09.476 --> 01:28:10.476
Bravely step up!

01:28:10.601 --> 01:28:13.101
Don't make stupid decisions
because of money!

01:28:13.226 --> 01:28:14.643
He's shooting at us blindly!

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:23.310
Shoot the thin guy in the corner!

01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:26.601
Two more bullets left!

01:28:26.726 --> 01:28:28.638
If they dare to take a step,
shoot away!

01:28:56.351 --> 01:28:59.060
Strong iron door!
Won't break even if we pound at it all day!

01:28:59.185 --> 01:29:01.310
Break the wall!
-Talked like you're a big shot!

01:29:07.101 --> 01:29:08.101
Go that side...

01:29:24.393 --> 01:29:25.560
Hello?
-Careful!

01:29:25.685 --> 01:29:27.810
What happened, Tips?
-No, Anbu.

01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:31.643
Some guy named Dilli got involved
and saved all the cops.

01:29:31.768 --> 01:29:34.393
Took out about three groups, too.
-Aren't you ashamed?

01:29:35.435 --> 01:29:37.226
Aren't you ashamed to say that?

01:29:37.351 --> 01:29:38.351
Hey...

01:29:38.935 --> 01:29:40.768
You better toss me the key
and get lost!

01:29:45.197 --> 01:29:46.877
If I ever get out of here...

01:29:47.476 --> 01:29:51.060
I'll kill not just you,
but every last member of your family!

01:29:52.143 --> 01:29:53.268
Toss me the key!

01:29:53.393 --> 01:29:55.268
(A song plays loudly
in the music system)

01:30:02.101 --> 01:30:03.476
Break it quickly!

01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:05.351
Hold on!
Come along!

01:30:05.476 --> 01:30:07.685
(A fast paced song plays)

01:30:16.143 --> 01:30:17.719
Why are you stopping?
Keep at it!

01:30:19.018 --> 01:30:20.101
Break it open!

01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:26.310
Turn it off.

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:33.226
Turn that thing off.

01:30:35.593 --> 01:30:36.968
Turn that damn thing off.

01:30:37.585 --> 01:30:39.044
Turn that goddamn thing off!

01:30:39.373 --> 01:30:40.498
Turn it off!

01:30:40.623 --> 01:30:43.331
Once I'm out,
I won't bloody spare any one of you!

01:30:44.873 --> 01:30:46.456
Can't handle one man?

01:30:46.581 --> 01:30:49.206
They've arrested my brother!
All five cops must die!

01:30:49.331 --> 01:30:51.806
If you got guts,
don't call until it's done! Hang up!

01:31:00.373 --> 01:31:01.498
Hey!
-Brother?

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:02.873
Start the vehicle!
-Okay!

01:31:04.648 --> 01:31:05.648
Sampath!

01:31:08.731 --> 01:31:09.731
Sampath!

01:31:22.064 --> 01:31:23.939
Tips can't handle this situation!

01:31:24.064 --> 01:31:25.356
You get going!

01:31:25.481 --> 01:31:27.064
The cops should not reach here!

01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:29.981
But the cargo is still inside!

01:31:30.106 --> 01:31:31.523
I'll handle that!
Now go!

01:31:34.106 --> 01:31:35.106
What happened?

01:31:50.148 --> 01:31:51.087
Sir?

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:52.274
Sir?

01:31:56.731 --> 01:31:57.898
Sprinkle water on him.

01:32:04.564 --> 01:32:06.357
He's still not waking up, bro.

01:32:09.689 --> 01:32:12.157
Bro...
You need to turn left here.

01:32:18.148 --> 01:32:21.314
Few folks in the list of Academy Toppers
haven't gotten a posting yet.

01:32:21.439 --> 01:32:23.606
Very likely they're working undercover now.

01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:25.231
Tell me their names.

01:32:25.356 --> 01:32:27.023
Just a minute, sir.

01:32:27.148 --> 01:32:28.148
Sathya.

01:32:28.273 --> 01:32:29.273
Sathya...

01:32:30.064 --> 01:32:31.148
Gunasekaran.

01:32:31.273 --> 01:32:32.273
Gunasekaran...

01:32:32.466 --> 01:32:33.388
Ajaz Ahmed

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:34.481
Alright, hang up.

01:32:58.939 --> 01:32:59.939
How much longer?

01:33:00.064 --> 01:33:01.481
(A peppy song plays)

01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.156
Ram!

01:33:53.481 --> 01:33:54.481
Yes, this is it.

01:33:54.606 --> 01:33:56.023
This is the place he mentioned.

01:33:56.148 --> 01:33:58.564
Think there'll be no further problems, bro.

01:33:59.814 --> 01:34:01.106
What do we do with him?

01:34:02.106 --> 01:34:03.439
Hold his legs.

01:34:10.981 --> 01:34:12.398
Prop his head up.

01:34:22.218 --> 01:34:24.273
Where is he?
-At Thavakudi School, Tips!

01:34:24.398 --> 01:34:26.273
You said he's going to a hospital.

01:34:26.398 --> 01:34:29.314
Why's he going to a school?
-Did he give me a damn itinerary?

01:34:29.439 --> 01:34:30.439
Hurry up!

01:34:42.898 --> 01:34:43.898
Good evening, sir!

01:35:02.814 --> 01:35:05.109
Ram! Ravi!

01:35:28.564 --> 01:35:29.731
They're done for, today!

01:35:32.731 --> 01:35:33.856
Anbu!

01:35:33.981 --> 01:35:35.689
Where's Anbu?
-I don't know, brother!

01:35:35.814 --> 01:35:38.189
No path here. Check that side!
-Let's go!

01:35:42.939 --> 01:35:44.023
Sir!

01:35:44.148 --> 01:35:46.439
They're about to break the back door!

01:35:46.564 --> 01:35:50.148
Heeding your words, I made those four boys
and the girl stay back here!

01:35:50.273 --> 01:35:51.856
When will you come?
-Sir...

01:35:51.981 --> 01:35:53.689
Mr. Bejoy can't come to the phone now.

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:54.814
Who the hell are you?

01:35:55.606 --> 01:35:57.939
Where is he?
Do you know what's going on here?

01:35:58.064 --> 01:36:00.689
I do, sir!
Been a part of this since it began!

01:36:00.814 --> 01:36:03.773
Don't be scared!
High ranking officials are on the way!

01:36:03.898 --> 01:36:05.981
I've heard the same thing for hours!

01:36:06.106 --> 01:36:07.981
If they get in,
they'll hack all of us up!

01:36:08.106 --> 01:36:10.106
Mr. Bejoy'd have to answer for this!

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:11.898
First tell me who you are!

01:36:12.023 --> 01:36:13.231
I'm just like you, sir.

01:36:13.356 --> 01:36:15.481
A stranger in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:19.273
Look in that place!
-Sir!

01:36:19.398 --> 01:36:20.939
Do you see anyone?
-It's Anbu!

01:36:23.606 --> 01:36:25.439
How many of you are in there?

01:36:25.564 --> 01:36:28.064
Including the girl,
there are five people!

01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:29.939
Trusting him, I had them stay back!

01:36:30.064 --> 01:36:32.564
Do they know who Mr. Bejoy is?

01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:34.398
I haven't seen him myself!

01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:40.023
The key is with that cop, Anbu!

01:36:41.856 --> 01:36:43.523
First turn that bloody thing off!

01:36:46.606 --> 01:36:50.314
Tell me, sir. How can they trust a guy
whom even you haven't seen before?

01:36:50.439 --> 01:36:52.523
They trust you.

01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:55.439
Only we must take care
of those who trust us.

01:36:56.148 --> 01:36:58.564
What?
Afraid you'll die, huh?

01:36:58.689 --> 01:37:00.814
Even if you die,
put up one hell of a fight, sir!

01:37:01.731 --> 01:37:03.439
Don't die cowering in fear!

01:37:03.564 --> 01:37:05.189
Sir...
-You're a cop, right?

01:37:05.314 --> 01:37:08.062
If anyone dares to step in there,
beat the crap out of him!

01:37:08.992 --> 01:37:09.804
Hello!

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.039
Sir!

01:38:00.231 --> 01:38:02.148
Careful, bro!

01:38:06.622 --> 01:38:08.021
Hold him, Ashok!

01:38:10.939 --> 01:38:12.552
Don't let him go!
-Be Careful

01:38:15.228 --> 01:38:16.768
Hit him!

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:21.352
Grab his leg!
-Give me a hand!

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.018
Come on!
-Do something, sir!

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.893
Careful, sir!

01:38:30.018 --> 01:38:31.102
Back away, Tamizh!

01:38:32.227 --> 01:38:34.143
Kick that knife away!

01:38:34.268 --> 01:38:36.018
Don't go near him, Chittu!

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.185
Come here!

01:38:42.477 --> 01:38:44.810
Where's the key?
-See if any door on the top is open!

01:38:44.935 --> 01:38:46.018
Go look!

01:38:46.143 --> 01:38:47.893
Stop right there!

01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:31.435
Get up, sir!

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.977
Break it, guys!

01:39:37.852 --> 01:39:39.311
Bend those bars!

01:39:50.893 --> 01:39:52.143
Come on!

01:39:52.268 --> 01:39:53.268
Go check that side!

01:39:55.393 --> 01:39:56.393
Be careful!

01:39:57.477 --> 01:39:59.227
No way here!
It's locked!

01:39:59.352 --> 01:40:00.727
Look that side!

01:40:00.852 --> 01:40:01.852
Come, Chittu!

01:40:05.185 --> 01:40:06.477
Come on!
-Hold on!

01:40:07.505 --> 01:40:08.643
Grab his hands!

01:40:08.768 --> 01:40:09.935
Grab them!

01:40:11.143 --> 01:40:12.268
Come, Tamizh!

01:40:12.393 --> 01:40:14.102
Throw me your shawl!
-Here you go!

01:40:14.227 --> 01:40:15.393
Hold him down!

01:40:15.518 --> 01:40:16.852
Grab his hands!
-Tightly!

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:18.018
Tie it tightly, Ajay!

01:40:23.527 --> 01:40:26.435
Bro!
This gun is so damn heavy!

01:40:26.819 --> 01:40:29.110
Can't shoot with one hand
like they do in the movies!

01:40:29.235 --> 01:40:30.777
It even drags me off to one side!

01:40:31.777 --> 01:40:33.152
Somehow, I managed.

01:40:35.027 --> 01:40:37.319
If I had not come along,
you two would've died, right?

01:40:41.194 --> 01:40:42.652
What is this?
No one's come!

01:40:42.777 --> 01:40:44.819
Shall I go take a look?
-Just sit quietly.

01:40:48.069 --> 01:40:49.610
Who are you, bro?

01:40:50.194 --> 01:40:51.319
Why did you kill?

01:40:52.485 --> 01:40:54.652
Just that you look like a killer.

01:40:54.777 --> 01:40:56.235
But you don't seem to be one!

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.194
That's why I asked.
Tell me, bro.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.541
Just mind your business.

01:41:00.682 --> 01:41:02.572
Just tell me, bro.

01:41:05.765 --> 01:41:06.765
Tell me.

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:12.009
How old are you?
-Just turned 23!

01:41:15.728 --> 01:41:17.645
When I was your age,
I had seen everything.

01:41:20.811 --> 01:41:22.020
As long as I can remember...

01:41:23.103 --> 01:41:26.228
...I was acclimated with fighting
and drinking. Remained that way!

01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:30.270
Viji.

01:41:32.561 --> 01:41:33.728
If she had not come along...

01:41:34.728 --> 01:41:36.603
...I would've been the same
until I died.

01:41:38.103 --> 01:41:39.103
She looked so good!

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.978
All eyes were on her!

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.228
But she was really fond of me!

01:41:49.478 --> 01:41:52.560
Dead set on marrying me,
she chased me all over and did so!

01:41:55.561 --> 01:41:57.884
Our home was under a tarp on a platform!

01:41:59.228 --> 01:42:02.353
To her, it was like living in a palace.
She was so happy.

01:42:03.895 --> 01:42:04.895
Every day...

01:42:06.395 --> 01:42:09.478
She'd ask me to keep flowers on her hair.
Mark holy ash on her forehead.

01:42:10.395 --> 01:42:13.811
She'd always swish around,
telling me to eat something she made.

01:42:17.061 --> 01:42:18.895
I hadn't known what life was.

01:42:20.212 --> 01:42:22.212
For the first time,
I wanted to live.

01:42:26.045 --> 01:42:28.795
If someone's born blind,
just let them be.

01:42:30.985 --> 01:42:33.146
But if you give them sight
for a while...

01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:35.670
...and yank it away
when they're happy?

01:42:39.769 --> 01:42:41.436
One day...
It was a Friday...

01:42:42.894 --> 01:42:44.269
A Vijaykanth film.

01:42:45.769 --> 01:42:48.978
Everyone in the platform
had gone for a late night show.

01:42:50.936 --> 01:42:52.394
Only the two of us didn't go.

01:42:52.947 --> 01:42:54.239
Because she was pregnant.

01:42:56.239 --> 01:42:59.187
We shut shop
and lay down to sleep.

01:43:01.156 --> 01:43:02.156
All of a sudden...

01:43:03.239 --> 01:43:04.864
...she screamed out to me!

01:43:07.072 --> 01:43:08.239
When I opened my eyes...

01:43:09.322 --> 01:43:10.864
...two bloody mongrels...

01:43:12.114 --> 01:43:15.114
...without even caring she was pregnant,
were carrying her away!

01:43:16.697 --> 01:43:17.864
What would you have done?

01:43:20.572 --> 01:43:22.531
I beat them.
I beat them hard.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:25.602
I beat them until they were dead!

01:43:28.989 --> 01:43:30.864
When they arrested me
and took me away...

01:43:32.031 --> 01:43:34.739
...that pregnant girl
stood in the middle of the road...

01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:38.469
...and cried asking me not to leave her.

01:43:43.322 --> 01:43:46.383
I didn't know back then
that it was the last time I'd ever see her.

01:43:52.447 --> 01:43:53.947
In the blink of an eye...

01:43:55.156 --> 01:43:56.322
...everything was gone.

01:43:59.947 --> 01:44:01.156
Her voice...

01:44:03.197 --> 01:44:04.406
The scent of her sweat...

01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:09.489
I have those memories
keep me going.

01:44:14.572 --> 01:44:15.572
Bro...

01:44:16.906 --> 01:44:18.406
Did she die?

01:44:34.281 --> 01:44:36.739
What is it?
Why are you still up?

01:44:38.239 --> 01:44:39.239
No, sister...

01:44:39.364 --> 01:44:43.447
I don't think anyone is coming
to visit me tomorrow.

01:44:44.572 --> 01:44:46.281
Are you crazy?

01:44:46.406 --> 01:44:49.572
I talked so much
but no one talked back.

01:44:49.697 --> 01:44:52.104
Doesn't that mean
they don't like me?

01:44:53.572 --> 01:44:55.697
Nothing of that sort.
You'll see.

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.239
They'll come to visit you.

01:45:15.906 --> 01:45:17.406
Get going, brother.

01:45:17.531 --> 01:45:19.923
Forget the truck.
I'll take care of it. You go!

01:45:20.864 --> 01:45:22.739
How do I leave this halfway?

01:45:23.864 --> 01:45:26.406
That's familiar territory to them.
They'll handle it.

01:45:26.531 --> 01:45:28.406
You focus on meeting your child.
Go!

01:45:29.406 --> 01:45:31.114
Like me, that man has a daughter, too.

01:45:32.322 --> 01:45:33.322
He's a good man.

01:45:33.447 --> 01:45:36.614
How do you know? What if he shows
his cop tricks in the morning?

01:45:36.739 --> 01:45:38.781
I've been in jail for ten years
with evil men.

01:45:39.781 --> 01:45:41.447
Good men look like temples to me.

01:45:41.572 --> 01:45:45.947
Some big shot! You promised to meet a girl
who thought she was an orphan until now!

01:45:46.072 --> 01:45:49.947
How would she feel if her dad
gets hacked to death on the way?

01:45:50.072 --> 01:45:53.156
The govt. will protect the cop's family.
Who'll take care of yours?

01:45:53.281 --> 01:45:55.864
Enough with helping others!
Go take care of your life!

01:45:55.989 --> 01:45:57.531
I'm pleading with you.
Please go!

01:45:58.781 --> 01:45:59.906
Just go, brother!

01:46:09.322 --> 01:46:11.489
What do we do with him, sir?

01:46:11.614 --> 01:46:14.506
Do you hear me, Anbu?
-Shall we lock him up in another cell?

01:46:14.531 --> 01:46:17.156
Why aren't you replying?
-Hold on. Let me ask Sir.

01:46:17.281 --> 01:46:18.281
Hey, Anbu!

01:46:18.989 --> 01:46:21.281
Damn it!
Someone respond!

01:46:22.156 --> 01:46:23.156
Anbu!

01:46:31.579 --> 01:46:34.688
"The number you're calling
is switched off at the moment."

01:46:53.242 --> 01:46:55.575
I sent someone
who can handle the arms.

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.659
They stabbed him
near the checkpost, sir!

01:46:57.784 --> 01:47:00.950
I don't know who did it or anything else.
-Alright, do this.

01:47:01.075 --> 01:47:03.575
Put these two bodies
into the school bus and go.

01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:05.659
Alright.
-I've spoken to Dr. Amudhan.

01:47:05.784 --> 01:47:09.200
It's very important that no one else
knows about this.

01:47:09.325 --> 01:47:10.659
Got it?
-Alright, sir.

01:47:10.784 --> 01:47:12.409
Take them to the Jojo Clinic.

01:47:12.534 --> 01:47:14.450
Say it's an emergency.
He'll understand.

01:47:14.575 --> 01:47:16.034
Okay.
-Let them remain with Ajay.

01:47:16.159 --> 01:47:17.159
Okay, sir.

01:47:20.825 --> 01:47:21.992
Tell him you're leaving.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:29.117
You get going. I'll join up with the boys.
-Yes, sir.

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:30.367
Hey...

01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:32.367
I came to see my child.

01:47:33.075 --> 01:47:34.617
I've seen what she looks like.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.909
I've heard her voice, too.

01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:39.034
Now I want her to be well!

01:47:39.159 --> 01:47:40.867
This man offered to help with that!

01:47:42.159 --> 01:47:44.867
What if I live through this
but something happens to him?

01:47:44.992 --> 01:47:47.200
Both our kids' lives will be ruined!
-So?

01:47:48.992 --> 01:47:52.325
It's not imporant for me to be with her.
Her happiness is more important.

01:47:55.117 --> 01:47:58.875
I've decided to save that man's life,
even if it means I lose mine.

01:47:59.075 --> 01:48:03.625
If she has a good school, think your child
will be happy even without her parents?

01:48:04.367 --> 01:48:05.367
Hey...

01:48:06.034 --> 01:48:07.409
You won't understand this.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.117
Can you do me a favor?

01:48:11.909 --> 01:48:15.325
When I was in prison,
I worked in a bakery for three years.

01:48:16.325 --> 01:48:18.117
With the money I saved from it...

01:48:18.242 --> 01:48:20.700
...as I was wondering what to buy
for her...

01:48:20.825 --> 01:48:23.825
...I remembered
that Viji loved 'jimikki' earrings.

01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:25.867
So, I bought the same.

01:48:27.075 --> 01:48:29.196
If anything happens to me
at the Commissioner's office...

01:48:29.626 --> 01:48:31.337
...can you get this to my daughter?

01:48:34.575 --> 01:48:35.742
Be careful.

01:48:39.825 --> 01:48:40.867
Say her father gave it.

01:48:42.492 --> 01:48:44.242
If she asks where he was...
-In prison.

01:48:44.367 --> 01:48:45.825
You dolt!

01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:47.200
What else do I say, brother?

01:48:50.992 --> 01:48:53.385
Tell her I was a painter in Dubai.

01:49:13.409 --> 01:49:15.464
We're going in a school bus, sir.

01:49:16.242 --> 01:49:19.242
Yes, to a hospital.
I'll let Tips know which hospital.

01:49:19.367 --> 01:49:21.825
That's an issue
between them and the cops.

01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:23.284
They'll handle it.

01:49:23.409 --> 01:49:26.700
But if Bejoy is left alive,
we'll be caught.

01:49:26.825 --> 01:49:27.909
Sir...

01:49:28.034 --> 01:49:29.325
Somehow, finish him off.

01:49:30.325 --> 01:49:31.492
How do I do that, sir?

01:49:31.617 --> 01:49:32.867
Don't be scared.

01:49:32.992 --> 01:49:35.159
Bejoy's men can't do anything,
tonight.

01:49:35.284 --> 01:49:38.909
Higher officials are involved with this.
So, they can't talk about this openly.

01:49:39.034 --> 01:49:41.200
Do what I say.
We'll handle it.

01:49:41.325 --> 01:49:42.742
Alright, sir.

01:49:44.742 --> 01:49:46.867
Pull over, driver!
Stop!

01:49:54.992 --> 01:49:56.659
Appears he's out of the funk, sir.

01:49:56.797 --> 01:49:57.571
Sir!

01:49:57.985 --> 01:49:58.696
Sir!

01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:02.234
I'm feeling better, sir.
Can I ride with you?

01:50:11.034 --> 01:50:11.987
Chittu?

01:50:12.322 --> 01:50:13.057
Chittu?

01:50:14.712 --> 01:50:15.825
Does it hurt?

01:50:19.078 --> 01:50:19.883
Hey..

01:50:21.492 --> 01:50:22.492
Hey...

01:50:23.601 --> 01:50:26.718
Sorry I slapped you.

01:50:37.575 --> 01:50:38.700
I love you.

01:50:45.075 --> 01:50:46.950
What happened, Anbu?
Look at me!

01:50:47.075 --> 01:50:48.700
Look at me, I say!

01:50:48.825 --> 01:50:51.075
Untie him!
Do it!

01:50:51.992 --> 01:50:54.492
Give him the key!
-Release Anbu and I'll let him go!

01:50:54.617 --> 01:50:57.409
He might do something! Give the key!
-Open up and I'll let him go!

01:50:57.477 --> 01:51:00.075
Open the door!
-Who the hell are you to decide that?

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:02.534
He's in your grasp
and you keep talking?

01:51:02.659 --> 01:51:04.367
Take him out!
Do it!

01:51:08.744 --> 01:51:09.911
Chittu!

01:51:28.742 --> 01:51:31.492
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I bloody tell you?

01:51:31.617 --> 01:51:33.492
It's all your fault!

01:51:33.617 --> 01:51:36.284
Had you given the key then,
he'd be alive right now!

01:51:37.159 --> 01:51:41.117
Now just him, but him,
him and her!

01:51:41.242 --> 01:51:43.325
There are thirty guys outside!

01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:46.188
Thought about what would happen
to you all if they came in?

01:51:48.242 --> 01:51:51.617
Brother!
I'll have the key in another two minutes!

01:51:51.742 --> 01:51:54.159
We'll take the cargo
and go home together!

01:51:54.284 --> 01:51:56.117
Together!
Now give me the key!

01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:58.825
What happened?
Where are the rest of them?

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.325
Anbu!

01:52:06.450 --> 01:52:07.830
Chittu!

01:52:10.075 --> 01:52:11.075
Chittu!

01:52:13.649 --> 01:52:15.227
Chittu!

01:52:20.325 --> 01:52:21.867
He's dead, sir!

01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:27.992
Didn't he stay back
because you asked him to, sir?

01:52:30.284 --> 01:52:32.534
He's just a corpse now, sir!

01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:38.825
Get up!
-Do you hear that?

01:52:40.524 --> 01:52:42.313
Chittu!

01:53:09.784 --> 01:53:11.534
Talk to me, Anbu!

01:53:12.534 --> 01:53:13.534
Anbu!

01:53:14.409 --> 01:53:16.575
Can you hear me, Anbu?
-Hey, Anbu!

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:18.325
Say something, Anbu!
-Come on!

01:53:20.424 --> 01:53:21.455
Anbu!

01:53:22.825 --> 01:53:25.007
They did something to Anbu, brother!

01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:26.288
Anbu!
-Anbu!

01:53:26.577 --> 01:53:28.537
Hey Anbu...

01:53:29.162 --> 01:53:31.116
What have you done to Anbu?

01:53:32.909 --> 01:53:35.075
Tips! Ram!
Where are you guys?

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.992
What happened to Anbu?

01:53:37.117 --> 01:53:39.617
Go check the back side!
Move!

01:53:43.492 --> 01:53:44.909
You're all dead meat!

01:53:45.784 --> 01:53:46.867
Open the door!

01:53:46.992 --> 01:53:48.367
Open the damn door!

01:54:00.784 --> 01:54:02.539
Ajaz Ahmed.

01:54:38.075 --> 01:54:40.617
Once we cross the quarry,
we reach town!

01:54:40.742 --> 01:54:43.159
Easy to go to the Commissioner's office
from there.

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:16.575
Sir...

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.075
No matter what,
don't leave the vehicle.

01:55:28.909 --> 01:55:30.159
Listen up!

01:55:31.075 --> 01:55:33.034
The cops you're looking for
are not here.

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:35.325
I've sent them off!
I'm Dilli!

01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:37.325
I got this, sir.
Get back!

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:39.492
I beat up your guys.

01:55:39.617 --> 01:55:41.413
Got anything to discuss,
take it up with me...

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:42.398
Bro...

01:55:42.867 --> 01:55:43.554
Dilli!

01:55:44.325 --> 01:55:46.325
This is it, sir!
He tipped them off!

01:55:48.077 --> 01:55:49.054
Dilli

01:55:53.825 --> 01:55:55.992
Hey! The gun has no bullets!
Come on, guys!

01:55:56.117 --> 01:55:57.409
Let him go!
-Come on!

01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:04.784
Come quickly!

01:56:04.909 --> 01:56:06.659
No! Listen to me!
Now go!

01:56:08.867 --> 01:56:09.992
Get going, I say!

01:56:13.909 --> 01:56:15.117
If I ever catch you...

01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:35.950
Just finish him off!

01:56:38.242 --> 01:56:39.242
Tell me!

01:56:40.284 --> 01:56:41.825
Sent them off in a school bus, huh?

01:56:42.992 --> 01:56:43.992
To which hospital?

01:56:45.617 --> 01:56:46.784
I don't know.

01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:48.950
"Don't know"?

01:56:54.075 --> 01:56:55.165
You don't know, eh?

01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:00.200
Make the guys check
every hospital in the area!

01:57:00.325 --> 01:57:02.075
Check if a school bus
is parked there!

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:03.575
Let's see how they escape!

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.117
First let's finish him off!

01:57:06.284 --> 01:57:07.284
Drop the rock.

01:57:07.409 --> 01:57:10.534
You'll leave once your job's done!
I'll be in trouble if he stays alive!

01:57:10.659 --> 01:57:12.284
Let's kill him!
-Drop it, I say!

01:57:19.659 --> 01:57:21.954
Can't nab one schmuck?
Hurry!

01:57:23.034 --> 01:57:24.742
He must be around there!
Search!

01:57:24.867 --> 01:57:26.659
Quit calling repeatedly!

01:57:26.784 --> 01:57:27.899
Catch him and get here!

01:57:28.784 --> 01:57:30.992
Call your man in the bus.

01:57:32.325 --> 01:57:34.367
I've asked you many times!
Do it!

01:57:34.492 --> 01:57:37.159
Give that to me, sir.
I'll handle it.

01:57:37.284 --> 01:57:38.325
Just give it!

01:57:45.075 --> 01:57:46.075
Come here!

01:57:47.096 --> 01:57:49.471
Take the gun in my pocket, sir!

01:57:50.575 --> 01:57:52.075
Don't hesitate!
Take it, sir!

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.669
There's no time.
Hurry!

01:57:55.367 --> 01:57:56.765
I think you got busted.

01:57:58.534 --> 01:57:59.534
I'm sorry.

01:58:01.492 --> 01:58:02.867
You should've left back then.

01:58:03.784 --> 01:58:05.034
Because of me...

01:58:11.367 --> 01:58:13.325
If you had a shave,
he'd look just like you!

01:58:13.992 --> 01:58:14.992
Right?

01:58:19.742 --> 01:58:20.742
Don't!

01:58:21.992 --> 01:58:23.534
Let him go!

01:58:25.534 --> 01:58:26.742
No!
Let him go!

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:30.159
No!
Just leave him alone!

01:58:33.075 --> 01:58:34.075
Ajaz!

01:58:43.742 --> 01:58:46.138
Now do you realize
who the sheep is, Sampath?

01:58:51.409 --> 01:58:53.367
My name isn't Sampath.

01:58:53.492 --> 01:58:54.492
It's Ajaz Ahmed!

01:58:55.575 --> 01:58:58.284
Batch of 2016!
Academy Topper!

01:59:00.159 --> 01:59:02.117
I've been by your side
for two years.

01:59:03.242 --> 01:59:04.825
And you didn't even know!

01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:06.534
You're the damn sheep!

01:59:11.992 --> 01:59:12.992
Ajaz!

01:59:18.575 --> 01:59:20.117
Hey!
Toss him out.

01:59:21.367 --> 01:59:22.992
He's up!
Grab him!

01:59:23.117 --> 01:59:24.117
Hit him!

01:59:57.692 --> 01:59:58.942
We must get them out!

02:00:06.434 --> 02:00:07.767
What happened, Jaga?

02:00:07.852 --> 02:00:09.602
They blocked everything, brother!

02:00:09.727 --> 02:00:11.102
There's no way to get in!

02:00:15.644 --> 02:00:16.810
Pull, guys!

02:00:20.477 --> 02:00:22.227
Come along!

02:00:23.477 --> 02:00:25.429
We got him!
He's got something in his pocket!

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:28.394
He won't let us take it!
-Don't spare anything! Check him!

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.958
Let go!
-Tips! Gaja's calling!

02:00:31.083 --> 02:00:32.833
Something happened to Anbu!
-What?

02:00:32.958 --> 02:00:35.000
He called many times.
Seems you didn't pick up!

02:00:35.125 --> 02:00:36.375
Let go of me!

02:00:38.875 --> 02:00:40.542
Give me that!
-Earrings, brother!

02:00:41.125 --> 02:00:42.167
What happened to Anbu?

02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:44.333
I'm coming!
Hang up!

02:00:44.693 --> 02:00:46.500
Brother!
Look!

02:00:48.042 --> 02:00:51.000
Brother! They snatched the earrings
you bought for your child!

02:00:51.125 --> 02:00:52.667
Open your eyes and look, brother!

02:00:54.125 --> 02:00:55.292
Are you kidding around?

02:00:55.917 --> 02:00:59.000
They broke the earrings
you bought for your child, brother!

02:01:00.458 --> 02:01:02.542
They broke your child's earrings!

02:01:04.792 --> 02:01:06.292
Brother!

02:01:06.417 --> 02:01:08.208
Open your eyes, brother!

02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:22.500
Stab him properly!

02:01:34.269 --> 02:01:35.769
Ajaz!

02:01:35.894 --> 02:01:37.872
Don't die on me, Ajaz!
Open your eyes!

02:01:38.771 --> 02:01:41.333
Run over the door with the car!
I'm on my way!

02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:55.407
Open your eyes, Ajaz!

02:03:02.394 --> 02:03:03.571
Don't let him go!

02:03:06.852 --> 02:03:09.935
You promised to meet a girl
who thought she was an orphan until now!

02:03:09.992 --> 02:03:14.140
How would she feel if her dad
gets hacked to death on the way?

02:03:16.685 --> 02:03:18.394
Do you want to see your daughter or not?

02:03:19.532 --> 02:03:21.357
Hello! I am Amudha speaking

02:03:21.490 --> 02:03:23.557
Are you coming to see me tommorrow

02:03:23.732 --> 02:03:24.693
Hello!

02:03:25.894 --> 02:03:26.894
Will I see her, sir?

02:03:29.102 --> 02:03:30.102
How are we related?

02:05:42.156 --> 02:05:43.156
Sir!

02:05:44.489 --> 02:05:45.656
Are you still alive, sir?

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:48.156
If yes,
get inside the vehicle!

02:05:48.989 --> 02:05:49.989
Let's go!

02:05:55.864 --> 02:05:57.073
Come, dear!

02:05:57.198 --> 02:05:59.531
Listen to me!
Come, let's go!

02:05:59.656 --> 02:06:02.198
Don't know what they'll do
if they come in! Let's go!

02:06:03.406 --> 02:06:04.406
Come on!

02:06:06.531 --> 02:06:07.656
Everyone head up!

02:06:08.573 --> 02:06:09.823
Keep going!
Don't stop!

02:06:09.948 --> 02:06:12.114
Break it open!

02:06:12.614 --> 02:06:14.864
Get inside!
Go in, dear!

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:18.560
Sir! Sir! Sir!...

02:06:19.698 --> 02:06:25.008
If they're in, no matter what happens,
they must not lay hands on her! See to it.

02:06:38.864 --> 02:06:40.406
Break it!

02:06:40.531 --> 02:06:41.614
Hit it harder!

02:06:41.739 --> 02:06:44.531
Rip out that tree and slam it here!
Bring whatever you find!

02:06:47.117 --> 02:06:49.114
Break it open!

02:06:49.239 --> 02:06:51.198
Hit it hard!

02:06:51.323 --> 02:06:52.323
Come this side!

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.614
Break it open!

02:07:12.739 --> 02:07:14.739
Move aside!
-Where are you going?

02:07:14.864 --> 02:07:16.906
This building...
-Give me the key, sir.

02:07:22.156 --> 02:07:23.864
Hit it hard!

02:07:30.639 --> 02:07:31.624
Hey Dilli!

02:07:32.614 --> 02:07:35.198
No matter what,
Adaikalam must not get out!

02:07:35.906 --> 02:07:38.823
The boys will be here in...
-That's a cop's problem, sir.

02:07:38.948 --> 02:07:40.739
There are others like me
stuck in there.

02:07:40.864 --> 02:07:42.281
Who will save them?

02:07:44.507 --> 02:07:45.757
Got any left?

02:07:45.882 --> 02:07:47.048
Booze, kiddo!

02:07:49.757 --> 02:07:51.007
Break it open!

02:07:51.132 --> 02:07:52.382
Break the window!

02:08:12.949 --> 02:08:13.949
Sir...

02:08:14.715 --> 02:08:17.757
You've sworn upon your child
that you'll give my child a good life.

02:08:18.548 --> 02:08:22.711
If you think when I'm dead,
I wouldn't know that you broke your word...

02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:25.291
...I'll kill you, sir!

02:08:27.257 --> 02:08:30.092
Break it down!
Harder!

02:08:38.798 --> 02:08:39.798
Brother!

02:08:40.965 --> 02:08:41.965
Be careful.

02:08:44.715 --> 02:08:46.257
Break it open!

02:09:08.132 --> 02:09:09.132
Sir!

02:09:10.673 --> 02:09:11.673
Let's go, sir!

02:09:12.548 --> 02:09:13.632
I'm with Mr. Bejoy.

02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:15.340
He's right outside.

02:09:19.715 --> 02:09:20.715
Where are those kids?

02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:22.340
Upstairs.

02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:33.600
Who is this guy?

02:09:38.090 --> 02:09:40.954
Get going!
They're waiting outside!

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.673
Come, Tamizh!
-Come on!

02:09:43.798 --> 02:09:45.680
Come, dear!
-Who is he, sir?

02:10:00.798 --> 02:10:02.257
Another truck out back!
Get in!

02:10:02.382 --> 02:10:04.257
This way!
-Come, Tamizh!

02:10:04.382 --> 02:10:05.882
Go!
-Get going!

02:10:06.007 --> 02:10:07.007
Get going, I say!

02:10:08.048 --> 02:10:09.048
Go, dear!

02:10:10.798 --> 02:10:12.468
A lost life won't come back.

02:10:13.798 --> 02:10:15.048
I'll bring him.
Now go!

02:10:16.090 --> 02:10:18.141
Take her and go, sir!
-Go, dear.

02:10:18.175 --> 02:10:19.425
Don't stop!

02:10:26.947 --> 02:10:29.280
You keep going, kids.
I'll be back.

02:10:29.405 --> 02:10:31.863
Where are you going?
-Go up those stairs. I'll tell you.

02:10:31.887 --> 02:10:33.311
Sir! Sir!...

02:10:34.530 --> 02:10:36.488
Where are you going?
-Take them up. I'll come!

02:10:36.613 --> 02:10:37.655
Come on, sir!

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:40.113
Come here, kid!
Here you go!

02:10:40.238 --> 02:10:41.947
Careful!
-Take him and go! I'll come!

02:10:42.613 --> 02:10:43.613
Sir!

02:10:49.363 --> 02:10:50.988
Look at this!
-Come on, sir.

02:10:51.113 --> 02:10:54.155
This is why those godforsaken mongrels
are creating such a ruckus!

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.572
Even if I die,
I won't let them take this!

02:10:56.697 --> 02:10:58.822
I'll burn down this entire thing!

02:10:58.947 --> 02:11:01.447
Let's see even if an ounce remains!
I'll burn it all!

02:11:02.322 --> 02:11:03.613
I'll hit you hard!

02:11:03.738 --> 02:11:06.197
They slit his throat
right before my eyes!

02:11:06.322 --> 02:11:08.863
Poor kid suffered!
He'd be my son's age.

02:11:09.250 --> 02:11:11.062
He died!

02:11:12.738 --> 02:11:15.197
You guys are done for!

02:11:17.905 --> 02:11:20.280
Let's see how
you get your stuff!

02:11:27.836 --> 02:11:29.572
Found it?
-See what this is, sir!

02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:41.072
They're drug peddling monsters!

02:11:43.197 --> 02:11:45.905
If they ever get their hands on
what's in here...

02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:48.280
...they'll ruin the lives of students!

02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:51.405
We must not spare them!

02:11:55.572 --> 02:11:56.572
Break it open!

02:12:17.725 --> 02:12:19.572
Hold it tightly. Don't let go.
-Who's this?

02:12:19.697 --> 02:12:20.822
I don't know, brother.

02:12:22.238 --> 02:12:23.655
How does this work?

02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:24.953
Press that red button.

02:12:33.655 --> 02:12:36.344
What's he got?
-Looks like a bug spray machine!

02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:44.030
Come on!

02:12:45.905 --> 02:12:46.905
Now hit it!

02:15:35.696 --> 02:15:37.405
It's nothing.
You're fine!

02:15:38.113 --> 02:15:39.196
Check him out, Vignesh.

02:16:21.155 --> 02:16:23.976
Plenty of cops outside!
What's wrong?

02:16:26.113 --> 02:16:28.030
I'm talking to you!
What happened?

02:16:39.185 --> 02:16:40.349
Sir!

02:16:40.575 --> 02:16:41.560
Dilli!

02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:43.321
Brother?
-Dilli?

02:16:44.071 --> 02:16:45.488
The Sir is here.

02:16:45.613 --> 02:16:46.696
Get down.

02:16:47.988 --> 02:16:49.613
What happened, sir?

02:16:52.613 --> 02:16:54.158
What is it?
-Show me your hands.

02:17:08.696 --> 02:17:09.946
Go.

02:17:10.071 --> 02:17:11.071
What is it, sir?

02:17:11.196 --> 02:17:12.569
Go and see.

02:17:35.738 --> 02:17:36.905
Is that my daughter, sir?

02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:39.780
Come!

02:17:43.905 --> 02:17:45.071
Just come!

02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:50.797
I'm scared!
-Come, dear.

02:17:57.113 --> 02:17:59.071
Go talk to him!
-What do I say, sir?

02:17:59.196 --> 02:18:00.613
Just go!
She'll talk to you.

02:18:36.446 --> 02:18:38.202
Are you my father?

02:18:42.407 --> 02:18:43.751
What's your name?

02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:49.423
Dilli.

02:18:50.007 --> 02:18:51.257
Why are you crying?

02:18:54.757 --> 02:18:55.796
I'm not crying, dear.

02:18:57.548 --> 02:19:00.539
All this while,
why didn't you come and see me?

02:19:08.715 --> 02:19:10.090
Please forgive me, dear!

02:19:19.257 --> 02:19:20.289
Don't cry.

02:19:22.048 --> 02:19:23.273
Don't cry.

02:19:27.968 --> 02:19:28.882
Dad...

02:19:30.298 --> 02:19:31.383
Don't cry, dad!

02:19:33.882 --> 02:19:35.048
My precious!

02:19:39.882 --> 02:19:42.757
You'll never leave me again,
will you, dad?

02:19:42.882 --> 02:19:44.257
I will not, dear!

02:19:44.382 --> 02:19:46.048
I'll never leave you again.

02:19:52.090 --> 02:19:53.590
I won't go anywhere
without you.

02:20:10.798 --> 02:20:11.923
So, Dilli...

02:20:12.048 --> 02:20:13.649
Is she like your dear Viji?

02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:19.492
Sir!

02:20:20.903 --> 02:20:21.786
Sir!

02:20:22.261 --> 02:20:23.544
Hey! Dilli

02:20:24.007 --> 02:20:25.715
Some men will meet you tomorrow.

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:28.507
They'll arrange for everything
you asked for your child.

02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:32.923
I knew you'd do everything
for my child, sir.

02:20:33.923 --> 02:20:34.923
I...

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.673
If I give something,
will you accept it?

02:20:45.268 --> 02:20:46.310
What is it?
Give me.

02:20:50.977 --> 02:20:52.310
It's a little broken.

02:20:54.185 --> 02:20:55.265
But pure gold, sir.

02:20:56.185 --> 02:20:57.685
Can you give it to your daughter?

02:20:58.685 --> 02:20:59.685
Alright.

02:20:59.810 --> 02:21:01.634
I'll tell her Uncle Dilli gave it.

02:21:12.227 --> 02:21:14.102
Who is he, sir?

02:21:14.227 --> 02:21:16.727
He wasn't involved with this,
but ruined everything!

02:21:19.810 --> 02:21:21.227
He is involved with it!

02:21:22.018 --> 02:21:23.508
His name is Dilli!
